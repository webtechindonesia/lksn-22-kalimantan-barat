Instead, it is recommended that you test RC2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-RC2.zip\">RC2 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-RC2</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-1/\">6.1-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks detailing all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What’s in WordPress 6.1 RC2?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Release Candidate 1, approximately 65 items have been addressed, bringing the total count to more than 2,000 updates since WordPress 6.0 in May of 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.1\">GitHub tickets</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=closed&amp;changetime=10%2F11%2F2022..10%2F18%2F2022&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=6.1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;order=id\">Trac tickets</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is the third major release for 2022, following 5.9 and 6.0, released in January and May of this year, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the highlights for both end-users and developers, you’re invited to read more about them in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-1-rc1-now-available/\">RC1 announcement post</a> and review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/wordpress-6-1-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.1 Field Guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Plugin and theme developers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.1 RC2 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.1. If you find compatibility problems, please post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of November 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Translate WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep WordPress bug-free – help with testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/09/21/help-test-wordpress-6-1/\">This detailed guide</a> is an excellent start if you have never tested a beta release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps ensure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. Anyone can take part in testing – regardless of prior experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">core-test channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today I have with me Nick Diego. Welcome, Nick, to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell me a bit about yourself, just kind of your history with WordPress and then what it is that you&#8217;ve been doing with the WordPress 6.1 release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I&#8217;m actually kind of new to working with WordPress full-time. Up until about June of last year, I was in the hospitality industry for a career of 10 years. But I always loved doing WordPress on the side. And after the long pandemic, I figured it was time to kind of pursue my passion and work with WordPress full-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that ultimately led to my current role as a developer advocate at WPEngine, where I focus primarily on WordPress and contribution to Core itself. And then I guess it was maybe March or April this year when <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>, who I&#8217;ve worked with a ton, she asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in helping out on 6.0 as an Editor Triage Lead which was an awesome experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I&#8217;m back for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. I always like to hear about people who are coming to do repeat tours of duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:01:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t refer to working on WordPress releases as a tour of duty. However, I find that releases are so large and complex, and there are so many people in there now that working on them takes an entirely different skill set now than it used to take when WordPress was like 1% of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think it&#8217;s a really big task, and I think it&#8217;s great when people were, like, that was either so good that I would do it again, or I would like a second go because I could do it better. Whichever way brings people to it. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:18]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I was just gonna say that&#8217;s a great point because the Editor Triage Lead, which is the role that I currently have, was a brand new role for 6.0. The project kind of got so big that it kind of made sense to have a triage lead focused specifically on Gutenberg. Gutenberg&#8217;s such a big part of WordPress now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s where that role kind of came from, and now we&#8217;ve carried it over to 6.1. As the project grows, we need more people to come in and help make sure the release is as smooth as it can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Because of that promise of backward compatibility and all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:48]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So, by the time this releases, if I recall correctly, we will have passed RC2, or RC2 is coming the next day or something like that. We&#8217;re right around the Release Candidate two. So you have been doing this for quite some time on this particular release. So far, what is the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about that&#8217;s going out in the 6.1 release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is going to sound really boring, but it&#8217;s actually incredibly exciting. So, the most exciting quote-unquote feature that I&#8217;m excited about is the improved consistency and standardization of block controls that are coming in 6.1. So things like typography and color and borders and dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are things and tools that we&#8217;ve had in a lot of core blocks, but it hasn&#8217;t been consistent throughout. And a ton of work has been done in 6.1 to establish that consistency. We&#8217;re not a hundred percent there, but typography, I think we&#8217;re at like 85% of all core blocks now support all the typography controls, and with each release as we head to 6.2, we&#8217;ll improve on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really great for theme builders, theme designers, and users to be able to control the look and feel blocks consistently throughout the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna immediately answer you earlier with like, there are no boring answers, there are no boring improvements. And as you were explaining why it is that you kind of thought it might be considered boring, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that anytime that you&#8217;re increasing the consistency and you&#8217;re increasing the confidence between what you saw on the back end and what you actually shipped on the front end– anytime you&#8217;re doing that, I think that that is exciting in the prove the negative way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about the negative excitement that occurs when you have published something, and it looks one way in the back end, and then it looks totally different on the front end, and the panic you feel when you have to fix. Not having that is a really big step up, I think. And so anything that provides more consistency for people who are using WordPress, people who are building with WordPress, I always find exciting. But also, like, I&#8217;m an office person, and so I would find office things exciting, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:04:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a more delightful experience. I do a lot of work on the Training team, doing educational things, and we teach people how to change typography and change color. Once they learn how to do it in one block, if they can take that same skill set and apply it to any other block, it&#8217;s that light bulb moment. They understand they know how to manipulate and use WordPress to its fullest. So adding that consistency really helps to level up users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna take us off track a little bit and just ask a general question here. Like, I remember the first time that I was working with what was a site, I guess, qualified for a site at the time. And I remember the first time that I discovered that I could change the look and feel with HTML and CSS, and I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also was like, well, I accept my fate. Whatever happens, if I kill everything I&#8217;ve ever written, that is just how it&#8217;ll be. Like the sheer terror of all of that is so different now. Do you recall that first moment where you&#8217;re like, Oh, I do have some power over this? I have some control over this, and whether you also found it scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:05:52]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came to WordPress kinda as a hobby and website development kind of as a hobby. So I was kind of always in that tinkering phase, or I wasn&#8217;t building something for anyone else. I was in a safe place to destroy whatever I was working on with my tinkering. So I never really quite had that fear, but I can definitely see it from the perspective of building something for somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the editor and the controls that we have, and you know, now make it a lot easier to kind of manipulate and exert your creative desires in WordPress than it was before with CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the phrase ‘I was safe to destroy things, ’ and if I can figure out a way to make it a tagline for something, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:31]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. So during your second time around here on the release squad with 6.1, what have been the bright spots of that experience, and have there been any unexpected challenges of being on the release squad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I come to WordPress from, you know, from a different career. It&#8217;s kind of a passion of mine to be working with WordPress. So I kinda have a unique experience than maybe some others. And when I approach WordPress, there&#8217;s always that tendency to say, ‘why doesn&#8217;t it do this?’ Or ‘why don&#8217;t they do this?’ And I&#8217;ve always been the person…, well, it&#8217;s open source. We, we, we can, we can</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…can do it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…we can do it. And so that&#8217;s kind of how I approach things. Now, of course, you know, I have the privilege of time to do that. Not everybody does, but one of the unexpected bright spots about working in a release squad is understanding how it all works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does WordPress actually get built? What is the process that it goes through? It was just eye-opening to me, and I really got a shout-out, Anne, for inviting me to be on 6.0. It brought me in. I learned so much about it, and now I&#8217;m just excited to keep working on these releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a release is hard. You know, it&#8217;s a… WordPress is huge. There are a lot of moving parts, there are a lot of things going on. Right now, we&#8217;re trying to get everything ready for the first release candidate. So being on the release squad is not an easy job. But it&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s fun, and you really feel like you&#8217;re part of that ‘we’ really helping to build WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I hope that people have learned from any time that they spent working with me is that like we understand here in the WordPress open source project, and I believe that all open source projects must understand this, but like every change that you make, if there are things that are dependent on it, which is gonna be true for most of us, we&#8217;ll have intended consequences and also unexpected consequences, and unintended, unexpected consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve always felt like the thing that really makes the biggest difference about how we do open source in WordPress is that, for the most part, we have a concept of where the most likely changes are going to happen across our entire ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a better understanding, at least compared to when I got here, a better understanding of how interconnected it all is. And so you&#8217;ve got this change here, and it looks small, but it&#8217;s gonna have this positive or negative impact as you kind of work your way out from it. And so I think that that is an interesting thing, and certainly, you get a really clear concept of it in the release squad, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, absolutely. If you were to build something like the block editor without caring at all about backward compatibility, you&#8217;d be done by now, right? I mean, so much of what we do is concerning ourselves with making sure that everybody who&#8217;s on a classic theme or hybrid theme or whatever it might be that they continue to use WordPress in a safe and stable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of being such a large content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you already told us the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about, and so now I&#8217;m gonna ask you about what feature or what bug fix has the most notable improvements that are coming to 6.1. This is a little different as in, like, there&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;re excited about, which is an office thing, but like a thing that is maybe not new but has the biggest delta, the biggest change to anyone&#8217;s experience of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so obviously, in 5.9, we introduced full site editing, and 6.0 was a natural progression from that with more and more features. Now it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;s only a small fraction of websites that are using the whole full site editing of or block themes, all that kind of stuff. One of the hangups about that was managing templates inside of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could add the files to your theme, which would then show up in the site editor. But there wasn&#8217;t a direct way to add more complicated templates within the site editor itself. That is changing in 6.1. So now you actually have the functionality to install something like 2023, which is the new core theme, and build out all these very complicated templates within the UI of the site editor that you could not have done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:10:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that the biggest benefit of full site editing is really to empower no-code or low-code users. And the ability to add these templates directly in the UI really levels them up. Because now, you can do all that complicated stuff that you normally would need to be adding to theme files and jumping into the code. You can do that within the site editor now, which I think is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. And just a general caveat, anytime that we talk about anything that&#8217;s very developer-y or very no code-y, I think it&#8217;s always worth mentioning, yes, a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do with the block editor is to just kind of give some power back to folks who cannot find the time to become a developer or don&#8217;t have the inclination. They don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that does not mean that no code is ever involved in WordPress. It&#8217;s still a software. You can still do very complicated things with it. And if you are a developer, you should not think to yourself, ‘oh now that it&#8217;s being available to low code/no code users, that means you don&#8217;t want me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s not at all what&#8217;s happening. You can do very complicated things still.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:11:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so that brings us to our final question here because we like to stay as true to the name as possible here on the WP Briefing. If someone were wanting to get involved with the next release, so WP 6.2, how would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:12:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, talk to Anne, and she&#8217;ll get you set up. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. So at the, after each release, there&#8217;s a posting that goes out that lists all the different release teams, and you can just put your name out there and ask to be, you know, for consideration to be part of the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will say that the best thing you can do right now is help with 6.1. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a release lead to do that testing, helping with bug fixes. Reach out to me. Reach out to other release leads, and we&#8217;ll get you involved and engaged with the release. That will give you a really good framework to start working and become a release lead for 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think we talked maybe two or three episodes ago, or it could be more than that, I&#8217;ll never know, about the release squad, like the group that&#8217;s doing that. In the event you think to yourself, ‘there&#8217;s no way in a million years that I&#8217;m gonna just show up tomorrow and be part of the release squad,’ I heard what they said in the first question/answer moment– that&#8217;s fine, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nick mentioned, you can always get involved with testing, you can get involved with triage. Those are areas where any feedback at all is valuable because we can get better information about what worked and didn&#8217;t, what was expected versus what happened. And that type of information is where all of our co-creators of the WordPress software–really, we rely on what you all are pointing out to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not shining spotlights on the most painful parts of your experience, sometimes we don&#8217;t necessarily know that that&#8217;s a pain point for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:34]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, that&#8217;s a great place to start. If you are more of a writer, technical or prose, there are different spaces you can go to, like keep our docs up to date or make sure that people know that changes are coming at all in WordPress because that&#8217;s a thing. If you are a backend developer, we have a million things you can do because that&#8217;s just all day, every day, for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just all the deep backend work. And so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:13:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to mention that, you know, being on the release team does not necessarily mean that you&#8217;re incredibly technical. We have a documentation lead, we have a design lead, you know, a communication lead. So there&#8217;s a lot of different roles in the team that, you know, across all disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don&#8217;t think if you&#8217;re not a hardcore developer, that precludes you from being on the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you&#8217;re really good with common sense and working fully remotely, you can be the release coordinator. I can tell you because I did that for 5.0. It was a big job. It was our, it was the first time we had a release squad as opposed to just like the release lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there was just so much that was going into that and so much riding on it. And like you said in some other answer that you gave like if you were to just be like, we&#8217;re shutting everything down and rewriting this in six months, and I hope you can come with us on it. Like a lot of open source projects do it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:51]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is a choice, and we made the opposite choice. And so we&#8217;re bringing all of our co-conspirators with us, all of our co-creators of WordPress. That&#8217;s the hope all the time. Making sure that they have enough information, that they feel safe to destroy things, enough information, and skills about how to get out of it, that they always feel some high confidence in what they&#8217;re trying to do versus what they actually did do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, excellent. Nick, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:15:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. I just hope everybody goes out and downloads 6.1 and enjoys it as much as I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, go check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And actually, it is a pretty big list today, but still pretty big things too. So first up, we have a call for testing that is out, and it is for our Android users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a call for testing for WordPress for Android 20.9, and I feel like we don&#8217;t get a lot of calls for testing for Android devices. And so if you have been feeling left out or just like we don&#8217;t always have that kind of mobile testing available, this is the opportunity for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that tomorrow, we have RC2, release candidate two for WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s coming out on October 18th. There will be a link in the show notes, but that means if you write a plugin or a theme or have anything that kind of extends the core of WordPress, now is the time to start testing anything that might be a bug or represent a breaking change and make sure that you file those bugs so that we can get things as settled and excellent as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of Word points, uh, WordPress 6.1, not Word point, WordPress 6.1. I actually have three changes that I think are going to represent some pretty big changes for folks. I will have links to all of these in the show notes. If you don&#8217;t know where the show notes are, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the three things that I think are gonna be big, worthwhile things. The first one is multisite improvements, and the second one will be the style engine that&#8217;s block styles generation tool, which will ship in Core and I think is really important for y&#8217;all to take a look at. And then also there are some changes coming to the block editor preferences.<br><br>Like I said, links to all of those are going to be in the show notes, and so they should be pretty easy for you to find.

Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-RC1.zip\">RC1 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available

Anyone can take part in testing – regardless of prior experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">core-test channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosey, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:12:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13533\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:306:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 is now available for download and testing.\n\nThis version of the WordPress software is under development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WP Briefing: Episode 33: Some Important Questions from WCEU\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/episode-33-some-important-questions-from-wceu/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 11:01:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13005\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy covers some important questions from WordCamp Europe on this special episode of the WordPress Briefing podcast. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:60:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/WP-Briefing-033.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13788:\"\n<p>In the thirty-third episode of the WordPress Briefing, hear Josepha Haden Chomphosy recap important questions from WordCamp Europe, and a selection of Contributor Day interviews. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 04:49:57 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 20:29:49 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220123300\";}', 'no');

The color palette is dark with a bright lemon-yellow accent color. It&#8217;s bold without being overly splashy, making it suitable for professional use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arc FSE does not come with any style variations, but users can easily change the accent colors for buttons, headings, and anything else by editing the templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme comes with 20 custom patterns, which make up different sections of the design. They are all conveniently grouped together under &#8220;Arc FSE&#8221; in the Patterns explorer, so you don&#8217;t have to hunt for the ones that belong to the theme. It includes full-page patterns for the home, about, services, and portfolio pages. There are also section patterns for things like the default footer, 404 page, a promotional video, sidebar, search cover block, services, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When first installing Arc FSE, the home page is set up to be nearly identical to <a href=\"https://demo.olivethemes.com/?demo=arc-fse\">the demo</a>, making it easy for users to get started customizing. It would be helpful to have a style guide for the theme, but for the most part you get what you see with the demo for the free version. Olive Themes also makes a <a href=\"https://olivethemes.com/wordpress-themes/arc-pro/\">pro version</a>, which includes additional features, WooCommerce support, and more blocks for things like testimonials and star ratings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arc FSE is good option for businesses, agencies, foundations, or artists with portfolios. After less than a week, it&#8217;s already being used on more than 100 sites. The theme is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/arc-fse/\">download</a> for free on WordPress.org. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 02:55:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13670\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6611:\"<p>Release Candidate 3 (RC3) is now available for testing! The general release is just one week away with WordPress 6.1 scheduled for release on Tuesday, November 1, 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This RC3 release is the final opportunity for you to test and help to ensure the resilience of the 6.1 release by performing a final round of reviews and checks. Since the WordPress ecosystem is vast and composed of thousands of plugins and themes the entire project benefits from the time you take to assist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test RC3 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC3 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-RC3.zip\">RC3 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-RC3</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-1/\">6.1-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks detailing all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What’s in WordPress 6.1 RC3?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Release Candidate 2, approximately 60 items have been addressed. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.1\">GitHub tickets</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=closed&changetime=10%2F18%2F2022..10%2F25%2F2022&resolution=fixed&milestone=6.1&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=milestone&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&order=id\">Trac tickets</a> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is the third major release for 2022, following 5.9 and 6.0, released in January and May of this year, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the highlights for both end-users and developers, you’re invited to read more about them in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-1-rc1-now-available/\">RC1 announcement post</a> and review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/wordpress-6-1-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.1 Field Guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Plugin and theme developers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.1 RC3 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.1. If you find compatibility problems, please post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of November 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Translate WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep WordPress bug-free – help with testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/09/21/help-test-wordpress-6-1/\">This detailed guide</a> is an excellent start if you have never tested a beta release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps ensure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. Anyone can take part in testing – regardless of prior experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one?

The navigation is jumpy and confusing, especially when going from template browsing to template editing to modifying individual blocks. A large PR is in progress for redesigning this UI with the introduction of a &#8220;browse mode&#8221; that would <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/james-koster-shares-design-explorations-that-transform-wordpress-site-editor-into-a-more-visual-user-friendly-tool\">make the experience feel more like a design tool</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg lead engineer Riad Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44770\">opened the PR</a> as a continuation of the ongoing work on this project, which has its roots in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23328\">ideas</a> and explorations that have been fermenting since 2019. He shared a video that roughly demonstrates the target for the proposed UI changes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>It essentially introduces a “navigable frame” where users can select from a menu of features on the left. More detailed efforts on improving the animations and placement of the menu items is happening simultaneously within the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original idea was to include the &#8220;Navigation menu&#8221; item inside the sidebar, but Benguella removed it in favor of keeping the PR contained to simply adding the &#8220;edit/view&#8221; mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although such a large PR has the potential to introduce a slew of regressions, Benguella said there is no other way around a big PR due to the the necessity of the structural changes to how the site editor is organized. He is attempting to keep it narrowly focused and not try to tackle features like browsing capabilities and adding UI (template lists, global styles, etc) to the sidebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is not without <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44770#issuecomment-1281312589\">some pushback</a>. Alex Stine, Cloud Platform Engineer at Waystar, warned against introducing another Mode into Gutenberg, saying it &#8220;feels kind of reckless considering we haven&#8217;t refined existing modes for all users.&#8221; He noted that Gutenberg already has select/edit mode contexts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This was a feature basically added for screen readers only,&#8221; Stine said. &#8220;I am hoping this will one day be removed, but we&#8217;re not quite there yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the community is trying to solve the wrong problem. If Gutenberg itself did not have such a complex UI, there would not be the need for a hundred different modes in a hundred different contexts, blocks, or even editors. We have gone so crazy making everything so quickly, no one thought about how to unify the interface across all editors. This feels like it could be another patch to a bigger problem.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stine cautioned against growing the UI for something that ultimately doesn&#8217;t make things any simpler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In a sense this PR doesn&#8217;t introduce any new mode, it just redesigns the current navigation panel a bit,&#8221; Benguella <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44770#issuecomment-1281319290\">said</a> in response. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s an opportunity to improve the a11y of the navigation in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The confusion in this PR is that it&#8217;s not about another mode in the editor itself, it&#8217;s higher level, it&#8217;s how we choose which template and template part to edit before actually entering the editor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the project&#8217;s contributors have been referring to it as &#8220;browse mode,&#8221; it is essentially a redesign for the existing UI to make it more intuitive for users to navigate. Gutenberg may not need any more new &#8220;modes&#8221; but the site editor is in dire need design improvements that will unify the experience and make it less chaotic for getting around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the most <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/24/editor-chat-summary-wednesday-20-october-2022/\">recent core Editor meeting</a>, Gutenberg contributors called for feedback on the big PR, since it has so many moving parts and needs more scrutiny. It&#8217;s not ready to land in the next release of Gutenberg yet, but the concept is rapidly taking shape and may expand to include more features in the sidebar once the basic structure is in place.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 04:14:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"Do The Woo Community: The Power of WooCommerce Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73101\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://dothewoo.io/the-power-of-woocommerce-blocks/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:374:\"<p>The WooCommerce team is actively exploring the interplay of block themes and full site editing within a Woo store.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/the-power-of-woocommerce-blocks/\">The Power of WooCommerce Blocks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Oct 2022 09:01:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"Gutenberg Times: What art can you create with WordPress 6.1?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=22528\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/what-art-can-you-create-with-wordpress-6-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4422:\"<p>Over the last year, the <a href=\"https://href.li/?https://block-museum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Museum of Block Art</a> was launched, built by and for the WordPress community.

Previewing works well and each file has attribution information readily available to copy. Clicking on &#8220;Get this audio&#8221; will take the visitor to the file on the external collection&#8217;s website where it can be downloaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deeper integration with WordPress core is on the roadmap for Openverse files. It would also be interesting to see WordPress&#8217; core Audio block integrate access to Openverse, in addition to pulling files from URL or the media library, the same way the Image block allows users to browse Openverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributors are currently exploring how they can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44496\">add basic Openverse integration to the inserter</a>. Matias Ventura, lead architect of Gutenberg, has proposed adding a Media tab to the existing tabs for Blocks, Patterns, and Reusable blocks, which allow dragging and dropping content into the canvas. This would offer more convenient access to the media library while building pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The inserter panel should support the ability to drag media from the inserter into the canvas, including dragging into block placeholders to quickly update patterns and such with your own content,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The Media tab would allow users to choose between categorized assets from the media library, and from Openverse.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Nik Tsekouras created <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44424\">a PR with a prototype</a>, basically a proof-of-concept, to explore how this might be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Development is still in the exploration and early stages, but this looks like a promising new integration that would make it easy for WordPress users to tap into Openverse&#8217;s catalog of 600 million free creative works.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 02:03:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"Post Status: New Venue Accessibility Checklist in the WordCamp Organizer Handbook\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=141561\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://poststatus.com/new-venue-accessibility-checklist-in-the-wordcamp-organizer-handbook/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3494:\"<h2 id=\"h-wordpress-community-news-roundup-for-the-week-of-october-17\">WordPress Community News Roundup for the Week of October 17</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may recall my prior post, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/5-days-without-a-shower/\">5 Days Without a Shower</a>, in which I wrote about my disability experiences at <strong>WCUS 2022</strong>. Writing things from a place of vulnerability isn’t always easy, but sometimes they’re necessary. Creating that post gave you insight into my experiences, and though I told them with a thread of humor, it was still not easy to share. But sharing with good intent, and with support, can help effect change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week the <strong>WCUS 2023</strong> team reached out to me in two ways, and when I tell you how warmed my heart was, you <em>still</em> can’t imagine the extent of my joy. First, <strong>Joe Simpson Jr.</strong> shared this new section of the <strong>WordCamp Organizer Handbook</strong> with me: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/first-steps/venue-accessibility-checklist/\">Venue Accessibility Checklist</a>. This is a HUGE step toward accommodating those with disabilities at WordCamps. The team also reached out to me as they’re touring the venue for next year with questions as they went through, inviting my input. Kudos to the Community Team on these great efforts and forward momentum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><strong>Black Friday and Cyber Monday</strong> are coming quickly! <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/submit-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals/\">Submit your deals on our site</a>.

The temporary loss of active install stats at WordPress.org has created an opportunity to rethink long-held assumptions and find new ways forward, so maybe it\'s not surprising that we made nearly the same selections. There\'s a single throughline in this episode — what works, what doesn\'t, and what will take WordPress businesses forward in the product, agency, and hosting spaces. A lot of people are thinking down this track and a lot of good ideas are coming forward. We\'ve tried to pull together the ones we feel are best. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/building-supporting-and-selling-a-winning-product-with-or-without-wordpress-org/\">LISTEN or READ →</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are Active Install Counts Relevant to Your Business\'s Success? (Even if they are accurate?)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/\">WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>,” <strong>Alex Denning</strong> argues the likely temporary loss of <strong>Active Install Growth</strong> data for plugin owners is not a bottom-line, business-relevant concern. Apart from the revelation that that data itself was not just obfuscated and inexact but “<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors\">basically garbage</a>,” Alex draws on <strong>Ellipsis</strong>&#8216; marketing experience and extensive data (as well as <strong>Iain Poulson</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">insights</a> at <strong>WP Trends</strong>) to show 1-2% conversion rates are the norm for plugins in the WP.org repository. Only a couple of big players can crack the 100k+ install tiers today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let\'s Fix What\'s Broken (The Plugin Repo) Not What Isn\'t (The Freemium Model)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Cromwell </strong>politely disagrees with Alex as he makes <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Case for the WordPress Plugin Freemium Model</a>. (There\'s a great <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1666180505764299\">Post Status Slack thread</a> on it too.) In it, Matt describes ways plugin owners can make the plugin repository\'s search engine work better for them, but Matt also notes a few of its deficiencies as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <strong>Justin Labadie</strong> and others <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/\">point out</a>, the search algorithm retrieves irrelevant results with more active installs than the plugin being searched for in many cases. It isn\'t possible to show all your plugins together anywhere on the repository apart from a buried profile tab under Contributor History. Even author searches do not retrieve every plugin from that source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt\'s  best point is that an average conversion rate is just that — an average. He\'s seen much better results due to marketing efforts he feels are accessible to many plugin vendors. Matt also points to examples of successful freemium plugin shops, like <strong>Paid Memberships Pro</strong> which recently did an A/B test with their pricing page. <strong>Jason Coleman</strong> reported <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_coleman/status/1582355558396743680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582355558396743680%7Ctwgr%5E60ce4bbce4981ae7479f4aaa2a1b7b13c8467ff3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattcromwell.com%2Fthe-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the version with a freemium option converted better</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">Follow Leaders, Adopt Standards</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10up</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">newly released resource site</a> for <strong>Gutenberg Best Practices</strong> is a signal WordPress has turned a corner.

Independently, we made nearly the same selections! It seems the temporary loss of active install stats at WP.org has created an opportunity to rethink long-held assumptions and find new ways forward. Our news picks are all related to this in one way or another.  So there\'s a single throughline in this episode — what works, what doesn\'t, and what will take WordPress businesses forward in the product, agency, and hosting spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are Active Install Counts Irrelevant to Your Plugin Business\'s Success? (Even if they were accurate?)</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>There are always going to be developers who push the envelope when it comes to littering the dashboard and just making it a difficult user experience. Maybe data is part of the way we solve that.</p><cite><strong>Eric Karkovac</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is <strong>Alex Denning</strong>&#8216;s article at <strong>Ellipsis</strong>, &#8220;<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/\">WordPress.org&nbsp;is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>.&#8221; Alex argues the likely temporary loss of Active Install Growth data for plugin owners is not a bottom-line, business-relevant concern. Apart from the revelation that that data itself was not just obfuscated and inexact but &#8220;<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors\">basically garbage</a>,&#8221; Alex draws on Ellipsis\' marketing experience and extensive data (as well as <strong>Iain Poulson</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ\">insights</a> at <strong>WP Trends</strong>) to show 1-2% conversion rates are the norm for plugins in the&nbsp;WP.org repository. Only a couple of big players can crack the 100k+ install tiers today. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Plugin Repo\'s Glass Ceiling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex notes this &#8220;glass ceiling&#8221; has a lot to do with how the repo\'s search algorithm works. It\'s biased to favor plugins that have many active installs already, so if you\'re not there yet, it\'s not going to help you get there. As a result of these observations, Alex disrecommends the plugin repo for anyone thinking about launching a business there on the freemium model. He considers WP.org a poor distribution channel and assumes the freemium product model\'s fate is tied to it. On that point, we\'re doubtful and optimistic about exceptions and opportunities for plugin developers to make their own way, with or without the repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Eric and I don\'t fully agree with Alex, his data-based analysis does establish that the plugin repository is &#8220;broken&#8221; if it\'s intended to be a place where a small entrepreneur with a good product can break in and take off. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Let\'s Fix What\'s Broken (The Plugin Repo) Not What Isn\'t (The Freemium Model)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Cromwell </strong>politely disagrees with Alex in a long, thoughtful post of his own:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Case for the WordPress Plugin Freemium Model</a>.&nbsp;(There\'s a great <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1666180505764299\">Post Status Slack thread</a> on it too.) In it, Matt describes ways plugin owners can make the&nbsp;wp.org&nbsp;plugin search engine work better for them, but he also notes a few of its deficiencies as well. His best point is that an average conversion rate is just that — an average. He\'s seen much better results due to marketing efforts he feels are accessible to many plugin vendors. Matt also points to examples of successful freemium plugin shops, like <strong>Paid Memberships Pro</strong> which recently did&nbsp;an A/B test&nbsp;with their pricing page, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_coleman/status/1582355558396743680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582355558396743680%7Ctwgr%5E60ce4bbce4981ae7479f4aaa2a1b7b13c8467ff3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattcromwell.com%2Fthe-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the version with a freemium option converted better</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Alex and Matt agree is how much the plugin repo has changed due to market saturation. It isn\'t an easy place to win in anymore. And I\'m pretty sure Alex would agree with Matt this is true across the web as a whole — you can expect to have to work hard with stiff competition and give high attention to <strong>Google</strong> as well — not to mention all the other things that go into making and supporting a good product. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ideas for Improving the WordPress.org Plugin Repository</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric and I also discussed the excellent suggestions for useful, actionable data that product owners — and even agencies — would like from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/five-takes-on-helpful-plugin-stats-and-insights/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a new, improved plugin directory</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Vito Peleg</strong>&#8216;s ideas are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitoPeleg/status/1577784069596876800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">especially exciting</a>&nbsp;and seemed to draw a nod from <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> on Twitter. We also note how better data for plugin owners might satisfy some needs that historically have led them to try all kinds of (often unpleasant) gimicks in the WordPress backend to connect with users and upsell or cross-market their products. In a comment at Post Status this week, <strong>Justin Labadie</strong> imagines <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/\">how this could work as part of the plugin install process</a>, along with other suggestions. Eric connected this line of thinking with <strong>Mark Zahra</strong>&#8216;s question in a recent post at <strong>WP Mayor</strong>, <a href=\"https://wpmayor.com/is-deceptive-marketing-ruining-wordpress-reputation/\">Is Deceptive Marketing Ruining WordPress’ Reputation?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plugin Developers Must Make Their Own Way</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric asked (and answered) a big question at the <strong>WP Minute</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/what-should-plugin-developers-expect-from-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What should plugin developers expect from WordPress</a>? You\'ve got to make your own way is a message I agree with, and I brought up my conversation with <strong>Till Krüss</strong> about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/till-kruss-on-wordpress-performance-the-plugin-business-and-life/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Performance and the Plugin Business</a>&nbsp;as an example of all the possibilities that open up if you think about meeting big needs nobody else is meeting or solving big problems others are creating! </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Follow the Leaders, Adopt Standards</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where we end up is <strong>10up</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">newly released resource site</a> for <strong>Gutenberg Best Practices</strong>. It\'s got tutorials, resources, references, example code — and they\'re encouraging use of <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices/discussions\">their GitHub discussion board for the site</a>. It\'s intended to go beyond the official WordPress documentation, according <strong>Fabian Kaegy</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2022/10up-publicly-releases-its-gutenberg-best-practices/\">launch announcement</a>. It\'s a “more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, that\'s a signal WordPress has turned a corner with Gutenberg. Top agency adoption of Gutenberg is huge, and as we see a growing body of accumulated knowledge, standards, and best practices emerging, it signals and amplifies a wave of change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building Products to Scale Opens Doors and Creates Opportunities for Growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Toward the end of the show I suggest that plugin developers (as well as agencies) targeting middle and low-end markets have tended to neglect standards around performance testing and security because their customers don\'t need to scale and because they can treat performance and security as a hosting problem. That\'s a barrier to accessing high-value enterprise clients, hosts, and agencies connected to both. It represents lost opportunities and money left on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-14 wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Also mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">10up\'s Gutenberg resource hub</a>, several other future-facing WordPress sites sharing tools and knowledge catering to different audiences emerged in the last week or so:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://olliewp.com/\">Ollie</a> from <strong>Mike McAlister</strong> is shaping up to be &#8220;a blog where WordPress creators can get handy tips, tutorials, and tools for the WordPress block editor and full-site editing.&#8221; </li><li>A <a href=\"https://www.modernwpdev.co/\">Modern WP Dev Course</a> is being offered by <strong>Joey Farrugio</strong> and will cover end-to-end WordPress site builds for SaaS and Enterprise clients.

What\'s the top one on your mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think the conversation around the removal of the active install growth data is just continuing, isn\'t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we\'re getting a lot of different points of view on it from developers, non-developers, and pretty much anyone else in the community who has an opinion on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Definitely. I\'ve been kind of pleased that it, you know, it settled down a bit and people are coming up with some pretty creative and constructive ideas of, um, well, just a lot of different perspectives on it. What did you think of Alex Denning\'s? He put out a newsletter last week, and I summarized some of that, and he put out a post. Um, now this week, um, that\'s not really surprising, but maybe a little sharply worded Stu um, kind of a bit of a, a shock to actually see it there that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. How did you, how do you feel about that? Take that, that the freemium model is not one his marketing agency would recommend necessarily as much as they did previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Well, I mean, the good thing Alex did was he backed all that stuff up with numbers. I mean, he has charts. He\'s showing how hard it is right now for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New plugin to get into the [00:02:00] repository and, you know, break through with either, I think you mentioned a hundred k, a 500 k or a million active installs. Now you see like the numbers of that just going down, uh, throughout the years. And, you know, that\'s kind of the issue the plugin repository has right now is that you have, you know, just a few really large plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you have. You know, plenty of them are, you know, related to automatic in some way. Um, and those are the ones getting, you know, the most visibility, at least when you\'re first visiting the, uh, the repository. So I think, you know, Alex makes a lot of sense and, you know, just kind of gave us an honest take of what the challenges are if you\'re trying to go with that model these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah, it\'s, it\'s definitely gotten to be. A tougher, um, tough market to break into. And yet some of his, um, important numbers come from [00:03:00] Ian Paulson. Um, uh, WP Trends put out some of that stuff too, that, um, probably the mix of, of consolidation in the market and, and just it\'s own maturity. Yeah. It\'s hard to debut and, and crack quickly into, into the upper tears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I always look at, I always wonder what the exceptions are and there are some, and he did note, um, a few. And if, yeah, if you can bring other channels and other, other marketing, um, if you have a significant marketing empire or like, um, awesome motive, but even I think on a much smaller scale, it\'s, it\'s definitely gonna help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this your only channel or, um, or, What did, um, what did you think of, of his take overall? You know, we have Matt Cromwell, um, kind of giving a, um, a counterpoint, [00:04:00] um, today. I saw that come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I, I think overall Alex makes a lot of good points. Um, you know, I\'m not a plug-in developer myself. I\'m not starting that business, but I could see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, if five to 10 years ago, if you were to dream about, okay, I\'m gonna create this plugin and it\'s going to kind of go viral within the community and people are going to pick up on it and use it, um, it, that\'s just not as realistic anymore. Um, you know, like I kind of referred to it on Twitter as like the wild west, um, you know, where anyone you could just, you know, start their own plot of virtual land and, you know, start selling and you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Break through that market. Now you are, as you said, you\'re up against these companies with large marketing budgets. Um, they, they\'re very skilled at getting the word out about their products. So if you were going to do this just through the repository [00:05:00] and, you know, as an individual or small agency, I\'m not sure, you know, you\'re gonna have a lot of success without just a major commitment and probably a little bit of luck and a great product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. His, um, his headline, um, Alex is, is the.org repo is ineffective for plugin distribution. You know, kinda generalization as of this, this year or so. Um, I would say that\'s, he\'s really saying ineffective as maybe a single channel for, for distribution. A freemium model rooted just in.org is a, i I would say that\'s always been, you know, why limit yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, why not, Why not cultivate other, other channels? And, um, we\'ve promoted partnerships a lot. A lot of people open up, um, other ways to get their, their plugin out by having hosting or agency partners that, um, make it easier. [00:06:00] Or required. It comes along with, with another product. Um, see Main WP is, um, packaged in with, at Tarm, which is packaged in with rocket.net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a, that was an interesting development there. Um, veto on, on Twitter was proposing a number of things that would be useful to get from data that, um, Matt Mullenweg, um, said, Hm, these are, you know, he gave some positive signals about that. Um, did you catch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I did. Yeah. And I, I think something will come back eventually, um, you know, as to what that is and how long it\'ll take Will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. be interesting to see. But, you know, I, that kind of goes into, you know, what should they be providing to plugin developers and what should they, you know, what, what should anyone really expect about that? I\'m sure that\'s something we\'re gonna kinda get on in a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yes. Um, I\'ve seen a lot of reasonable opinion just come that the [00:07:00] more and more to, let\'s do what dr.org does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just release all the raw data. Don\'t interpret it on.org maybe, but leave that to however people choose to use it. And, and you could do an opt-in, opt out if you don\'t want your, your, um, your metrics in the mix. You can opt out or privatize, you know, only I get those. But the aggregate, uh, signal coming out of there is of high interest to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a lot of levels to a lot of people, including researchers. Um, and as, as Alex mentions, I\'ve said a lot, it\'s a data poor market and anyone who\'s curious in understanding it, uh, WordPress ecosystem, you want the, want the data, um, what you do with it, what you think it means is a whole, whole nother thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I think it seems like there\'s an agreement too, kind of a consensus emerging that, um, Actually that growth, that growth number isn\'t [00:08:00] or hasn\'t been, um, terribly useful. So it\'s sort of irrelevant to, um, on a lot of levels Alex would say, because it\'s, it\'s not gonna help you, um, in this market anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but, um, you know, there\'s, there\'s other more useful things we could potentially get out of there. Um, yeah, so Matt\'s, Matt\'s take, I think the, for both of us, those are the two. This dialogue is um, kind of the top of mind thing here. Um, did you get a chance to break into, think through Matt\'s comments today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, so Matt Cromwell kind of gave a, a very respectful rebuttal to, uh, Alex Denning, um, which I like to see. Cuz you know, we can have those disagreements and you. And still talk about it rationally and, you know, uh, as community members and not as adversaries necessarily. So I think that that was the absolute right approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, Matt kind of went [00:09:00] into the plugin repository search algorithm and says that, you know, if, if you go in there and optimize your product with the right name or, um, tag your product under, you know, relevant, uh, terms, You can still be found in the search engine. Um, it\'s not necessarily, um, that you\'re gonna have the immediate visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s go going on the repository and, you know, seeing like, um, the classic editor or Yost or something like that. But you\'re going to be able to be found if you, if you optimize. And he also said that, you know, in his experience with plugins and he\'s worked with a few of \'em, give WPS the one that comes to mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, You can actually convert a lot more, uh, freemium users into, uh, paying customers than the one to 2% that, uh, Alex Denning was uh, mentioning in his post. So, uh, I, I think that\'s, you know, so he, he\'s actually lived it a [00:10:00] bit and I think that\'s, um, mm-hmm. , you know, very relevant, I think kind of good news for other people that are trying to break into</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I\'ve always thought that if you\'re using that model or any model, you should be doing everything you can as soon as you have any kind of audience to get in relationship with your best users. You know, figure u usually you\'d have some kind of persona, you know, you, you know who your, your target audience is, and then maybe that revises over time as you, you get to actually know them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\'s the best data you, you can get. Finding ways to develop that, um, that relationship is, um, is really key. There\'s then you, you kind of take control of your, you\'re not sitting back passively looking for a number to come in that might be dubious, um, is a big generalization. Um, can you get together a focus group or something like that?[00:11:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, um, the thing that. I, I think, uh, resonated seems be resonated with a lot of people. With, with Matt\'s, is that that number you mentioned yet? Alex, Alex is speaking of, um, this, going through a lot of data. This is a general figure. This is the, the kind of conversion you can expect on a freemium plugin in, in the, um, what do you, uh, in the, in the.org repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s, that\'s an average. So, An average for 50, 60,000 possible. Um, I suppose I\'m not, I\'m not sure what the restricted, um, data set is that they\'re looking at. Maybe it\'s a little more targeted than that, but, um, you may not be the average. Do you want to be the average? Do you want, do you wanna market yourself and, and consider your, your success based on relative to, to an average?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you wanna do 200 [00:12:00] times better than that? Um, and I, I would say, yeah, shoot for that is, is, is that kind of where you, you see Matt, um, saying, Look, there\'s, there\'s plenty of ways to be an exception to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, one of the things he mentioned was, you know, it also depends on the category, the type of plugin you\'re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. . If you\'re competing against the big SEO plugins or form plugins, for example, you\'re gonna have a hard time. There are a lot of established plugins out there that do these things and that have massive install numbers. Um, but if you have a great product that is in the right niche at the right time, there\'s no reason why you still can\'t have success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah, I mean, one to 2% is kind of low. Um, but that doesn\'t mean your particular plugin is going to have to settle for that. I mean, Regardless of where you put your plug in. And I, I think, um, both [00:13:00] gentlemen agreed that, you know, dot org is a lot different than it was a few years ago, But regardless of where you put that effort, you still have to put in a lot of work in order to get good results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, Right. It, it\'s, you know, it ultimately it\'s up to the, to the developer, um, to market their product, to make a great product. And, you know, That, that\'s what\'s gonna lead to the results more than just, it\'s, it\'s home on the web basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right? Yeah. There, it, it seems to me like there\'s a, there\'s an important perspective, um, shift that it\'s, it\'s worth, um, considering if there\'s kind of, there\'s a, there\'s a, you can look at at general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall market numbers. You can try to look at how peers are doing within a certain trench there. And, and then there\'s the numbers you generate yourself and the, and it, it\'s somewhat, it [00:14:00] can be somewhat disempowering to, to get over occupied with, um, um, comparison to others. Um, just the whole psychology of that is that really doing well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Or do you wanna define your own? I remember when, um, like some years ago, MailChimp or people in the newsletter marketing, um, world posted, here\'s industry averages on open rates and click rates, and I don\'t know where exactly how they computed this. Um, uh, I think the ones coming from MailChimp are based on their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Okay, this is probably reliable. And then, and then some years later, I\'ve, I\'ve seen totally. Figures, but um, in reference to that, like, wow, we\'re consistently two, three, even four times over that. So great . But is there really any actionable, um, data in that there, there\'s such broad, um, broad [00:15:00] figures. What, what, what do you think are the useful, um, practical things coming out of this, out of this conversation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see Matt has some things that they agree. It is tougher these days. Um, the market has changed a lot. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> yeah, I, I, I just think it\'s, it\'s a long overdue conversation. It\'s kind of funny that it took this particular incident to kind of spark it, but mm-hmm. , you know, as I said, if you\'re starting a, uh, a plug-in business today, it\'s so much different than it was a few years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I think this could only benefit people in that position. Right now. They\'re, they\'re seeing both sides of the argument. They\'re seeing, you know, how they fit into, to what\'s happening out there in the WordPress community. So, you know, it, it\'s, it is very productive at the very least. And hopefully it leads to, you know, Some rethinking of the [00:16:00] statistics that really matter and that allow developers to make good</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Yeah. Um, I\'d, I\'d really like to, I\'m one of those who likes more data just to out of curiosity and analysis of, you know, understanding. The market as a whole, but when you\'re, when you\'re actually doing, making practical moves for your, your business, everyone\'s unique or different and, um, you know, or do you have a extension in the W commerce, uh, marketplace?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a growth area. Uh, that\'s, is that, do you have all your eggs in one basket? Um, everything that Matt says at the end, that\'s a practical tip is like kind of a no brainer, but you get distracted from that. Pretty easily by looking over your shoulder at another side, I suppose identify your niche should keep it focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, launch day one with your free and paid options. Focus on user experience and excellent customer [00:17:00] support. I think those are, those are really key and are under, under practiced, um, across the, the board, um, user experience all the way to plays well with others. How, you know, whether you\'re bombarding people with notifications to, to upsell them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there was, someone recently suggested a standard, um, a kind of industry, uh, standard way of doing that, that was part of the discussion. Um, maybe like the in line with WP Notify, What if we get to a consensus on, um, ways to reach. With freemium plugin plugins to, to the audience instead of all trying our own things inside the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything else in that discussion or any other contributions to it that, um, you\'ve been reflecting on this week? Any anyone else writing in [00:18:00] on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I, I think you know, what you just mentioned about the notifications is interesting because we had, uh, You know, the post that Mark Zara, uh, had a couple of weeks ago about the marketing tactics, it kind of got me thinking about this data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, if you have accurate, actionable data, do you need to really go down the rabbit hole with some of these unsavory, I guess I\'ll call them marketing tactics, You know, if you had that access to the right data. You know, right now it\'s so open to experimentation because people may not exactly know what the right path is for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they\'re going to experiment. They\'re always going to be developers who push the envelope when it comes to, you know, littering the dashboard and, and just making it, uh, uh, a difficult user experience, I guess I should say. Um, [00:19:00] maybe data is part of the way we solve. Yeah. I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I think that that\'s a good, a good tangent for this to, to go in tho Those two seem related to me as well because they\'re, they\'re two parts of that transaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, they\'re due to the not having. Telemetry and you\'ve gotta find some other way to reach out. And the easy, the low hanging fruit has seemed to be, well, let\'s put in a big, you must respond, you know, something where people are gonna click on it and, um, and respond. Um, but then there\'s all this pushback against that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other, other forms of marketing, like you\'ve, you\'ve mentioned, like Mark\'s mentioned, I should bring that up with him and see what his thoughts are since he\'s recently weighed in on both. And that that is ultimately though the user experience is where you get the, the pushback. Um, they want [00:20:00] someone using your plugin, um, may actually want to give you feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you find an appropriate channel? It\'s such a, it\'s such a one way transaction. Um, yeah, I don\'t, it seems like there should be some opportunities there and if there was collaboration, In the plugin industry to, hey, this is how we\'re all gonna do this. If there was a cluster of, of people or, or one particular company or, um, a group that agreed, let\'s try this particular way of, um, standardizing how we do this part of the interface, how we reach out to customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I don\'t think we do anything as a community to set expectations at all or to educate people who are just casual users. And that cascades into them. Just, you know, never really entering more deeply into, into the WordPress project as maybe as much as they would. Um, [00:21:00] I wonder if there\'s lost opportunities there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s a good one. The notification thing I is a pet issue for me too. No one likes it. . No. No. Well, the other, the other thing I was gonna. Mention ties in into your, your other pick too. You, you wrote a piece on what developers should expect from, um, from WordPress and, Yeah. What, Let me walk us through your, your main points there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. So, you know, with, with all the, the talk about the data being removed, that also kind of got me thinking of, well, you know, what is it that if I\'m a plugin developer, what should I expect from the WordPress project? You know? And my conclusion is that I don\'t know that the WordPress project is necessarily interested in helping you make money off of your plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know? Mm-hmm. , they\'re providing us with a [00:22:00] platform. That we can build on. So there\'s the opportunity to make money, and they\'re offering us, you know, documentation and, you know, different events and things like that to help us learn, um, how we can use the platform for, for our needs. However, you know, when it gets to the point of, you know, are, are they in the market to help any big plugin developer make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, should they be, Is that something that. You know, we should reasonably expect them to care about, um, you know, like personally, I felt like the data that was there, they should have done a, a much better job in explaining why it was removed. Because I think that is the part of it that gets people fired up the most perhaps, is that there\'s just no explanation for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s no official word. You know, there\'s a, a rumor here and there. In, when you look at it [00:23:00] in, in a, uh, broader view, is that data something that WordPress owes to plug in developers necessarily? Right. So that was kind of my point as to, you know, Yes, we\'ve missed this data and it could be useful, but we also have to realize that every one of these plug-in developers is a third party entity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of them are commercial, including automatic, and so. , you know, are we going to expect WordPress to facilitate our money making? You know, that\'s ultimately up to the company. That\'s up to the developer, right? Um, they\'re giving us the tool to build upon and you know, we take it from there. And that\'s right kind of where it ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Exactly. Um, yeah, it\'s a bit of a humbling message, but I, I think it\'s, it\'s an over overdue one. And, and maybe that\'s actually a good, explicit conversation to [00:24:00] have. What, what should, what should the project set as expectations? Um, can those be explicitly laid out, um, to people who are in the extender category of, you know, building plugins and themes and services?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you, you often, You know, Des describing. The very large realm of third party, um, businesses built around WordPress, um, describing them as, as super fans, um, is, is an interesting thing. I I, I kind of had a chuckle out of, because I, I think there\'s another side of that perspective where it\'s like, you know, with friends like these, you , like this is the, the people who.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, con, you know, everyone, everyone who\'s had some success or prominence in, in the market, there\'s a, there\'s a strong tendency towards maybe conveying, you know, especially if you\'re Twitter, active personality, God\'s gift to, uh, [00:25:00] to WordPress and expanding the market here and well from, um, from other, other perspectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to other projects, testing performance is, uh, something that a lot of third party, uh, products have delegated upward to hosts to deal with. Um, it\'s not just WordPress core, although that\'s there, but, um, the tightening focusing in on performance now, I, I think is really important. But it\'s something that, um, you know, unlike other projects, Testing is not as, um, aggressively implemented or standardized, um, across the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get stuff in the, in the repo without, you know, necessarily doing, you know, end to end deep testing of, um, for security and performance. And I think any, anything, any developments on [00:26:00] that front are, are to be encouraged. There\'s. That\'s ongoing. But, um, if, if plugin developers really took charge of that, um, that\'s an area that there\'s clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear synergy and, uh, alignment of interest with e everybody. And I think that\'s where everyone benefits. Um, you, you may not be owed anything, but um, for your, for your, your contributions, but everyone benefits when, when those are good, when, uh, when everyone\'s kind of aligned and, and, uh, performance and, and security are, are ones where just absolutely everyone is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In, in it together? No, no one, um, everyone has an interest in, in everything performing as well as possible and being as secure as possible. So that, that kind of touches the, um, the other thing I wanted to bring up, which is one of our own, um, back in August, [00:27:00] I, uh, recorded a, a conversation with Tell Chris, um, who\'s Object Cash Pro and is working on a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product, Um, and has had huge success with a high value hosting market. Partnerships with, with that, he has a freemium plugin that is also super valuable. That is originally from a forked product of, um, I think some core, core developers quite some time back about a decade, um, that they, they established and then left and, and till took over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, with his own, his own versions, he has over a hundred thousand. Installs tracked on the on the.org repo with that. But his premium product, which actually is not open source to protect, to protect it as intellectual property, um, that is where you get the big, the bigger revenue from fewer clients [00:28:00] because it appeals to hosts who have such, or anyone who has such a high volume of traffic paying you a thousand bucks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, a month. Is saving me 20 20,000 on the bandwidth that, so it, it\'s kind of, um, it\'s a, it\'s a really fascinating model that I think doesn\'t translate to everybody. It\'s a niche product, but there are lessons from it that really do, and it\'s how can I build something that\'s so tested rigorously and so performant that I don\'t have more than like five minutes of support time a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin developers complain, , plugin, plugin businesses are complain about support. So amazing relationship there with kind of sell itself and, and two, this is coming from someone who is self taught, I believe, largely self taught developer who then spent time outside of WordPress in Lve and got deeply into performance and, and testing and brings a [00:29:00] rigor from that project back to WordPress, which is sad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not common and not part of the culture and not intensely supported and taught. Um, so I, I think those are things plugin developers can look to and, and learn from. I don\'t know if you had a chance to listen to that. I, I actually did more writing about, about that conversation the more I thought about it than I usually do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. Hi. His story is very interesting and I said going to the hosting market. Is really unique. No, I mean, how many WordPress plugins are really doing that? And I think what he shows is that there are still opportunities. If you have something that is very niche that you don\'t have to necessarily even worry about the plugin repo so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And it\'s partly an opportunity that\'s been, it\'s very stereotypical. It goes back a long way. It\'s an [00:30:00] structural feature of, of WordPress culture and, and software engineering. Um, he\'s solving a problem that exists because WordPress. Is is not super competitive on the performance front. More and more, that\'s more and more an issue at time, uh, over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'s being more aggressively dealt with now. Uh, but a large part of that, I remember 10, 15 years ago, you know, hosts, it was like a glass half full glass, half empty. Everyone\'s installing WordPress and 250 plugins, and some of them are nuts, . And it\'s like it brings it to a crawl. Um, so there\'s been this huge boom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Managed WordPress hosting and really to cater with that to, to that. Um, and I think, and it\'s not just that all P h p MyQ, um, CMS platforms that got popular around the same time, you, you can, you [00:31:00] know, left to your own devices someone can install and quite a lot of stuff on there and. That\'s never, performance, hasn\'t been pushed to as a core competency and responsibility of third party developers in, in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that\'s really overdue and is hugely in their interest and until has a, a winning product because it matters so much at scale. Um, and that\'s another, that\'s another thing if your plugin doesn\'t. Doesn\'t, wasn\'t conceived of and architected towards, towards scale. Well you, are you going to be able to market this, um, in a higher tier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this something that a V I P agency is gonna do code review and say, you know, we like this future set, but, um, you know, uh, uh, this is gonna, here are, here are issues with security, [00:32:00] performance and so on. I think that sort of. That sort of barrier is there and maybe not talked about as much as, as it should.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s a lot of learning, um, that could happen there that\'s constructive. Um, if you\'re going for a middle or low market, maybe you don\'t think about that as much, but there\'s a lot of high dollar value in having, having something that is going to be adopted by high value market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, if you make yourself indispensable to, uh, Larger installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think you could find yourself, uh, doing pretty well in this space. But, you know, talking about performance, I mean, there\'s really not a lot of formal educational opportunities out there right now for that. Um, you know, and the kind of the. Blessing and curse of programming is that you can build things more than one way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, if you ask me to build you a form, I can build you a form in many different ways. [00:33:00] Doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s gonna be the most performant. Um, and you know, if there\'s no real standard or there\'s nobody sitting there and, you know, testing all of these things, um, before they get into repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re, you could be stuck with something that you know isn\'t very performant and, you know, the average site owner\'s not going to know that there are faster, better alternatives. So that\'s kind of the, the, uh, the challenge we find ourselves in right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I\'ve, I\'ve said before, somewhat, you know, half serious, you know, that I would love to see statistics on, you know, what\'s the average amount of, of queries, queries that this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin will add to my site if I install it. And is it arbitrarily loading dependencies and, and adding, adding page weight on, um, absolutely every page load? Or is it just doing that where it needs to? There there are [00:34:00] things like that that, um, I think public attention to would, would have a, be. Impact. Um, it just hasn\'t, hasn\'t really been considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have a third, uh, third item or, or was the Alex and, and Matt, the kind of counting his too. Did, Is there one more? Um, Pick of the week for</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> you? Well, I, I, I think, uh, I was really interested in, in looking at, uh, 10 UPS Gutenberg best practices site, cuz that kind of ties into this a little bit with the education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\'s a very big agency, does a lot of, um, large WordPress based projects and they\'re kind of sharing their methods for building Gutenberg blocks, for working with block themes and the theme json file. Um, and you know, maybe that\'s one of our solutions community. Mm-hmm. members that have had success and have a reputation for quality sharing, how they do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know web dev [00:35:00] studios has done similar things in the past where if you can kind of see how they do things, maybe that rubs off on other developers and they also, you know, build things to be performant and sustainable. Um, you know, that\'s the kind of information I think is, is really just crucial to have cuz it goes beyond just the basic documentation that WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> provides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. I, I\'ve, um, I was pleased to see that come out. I\'ve kind of been looking for that for years. I was like, you know, knowing that\'s kind of a bellwether, you know, we\'ll have turned a corner when, when you see the, um, top agencies, uh, turning. Um, case studies, documentation, tutorials, explainers that are, are really useful and, and helpful, but are also signaling, hey, they\'ve, they\'ve turned the corner on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are, they\'re doing Gutenberg first, um, with, with new, new site builds. Um, [00:36:00] and I, I think I, I\'ve never seen anyone mention this, but. I, I feel that there\'s a, um, there\'s a need there. Maybe there isn\'t enough of a hunger for, for unofficial standards. Uh, when, when back, way back when managed hosting, um, started to come out and, um, I remember WP Engine was, I think the, the first I recall where there was a public list of do of plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\'t allow or, Yeah. Um, and I was like, Cool. That saves me a lot of time, . And I, I kept up with that and I kind of, I aligned my own lists with that and, and tried to learn, Okay, why is that? And to kind of sharpen my own understanding of. How experts are, are picking and screening and you know, you look at, um, WordPress v i p documentation, I, I\'ve done that from time time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, what is their [00:37:00] perspective on, on ACF or, um, or, or something else that, uh, I, I don\'t, I don\'t know that that\'s done at. People who are serving a kind of lower middle market and who can count on, let\'s just, we\'ll just throw more server horsepower on that, that will be the client\'s problem. Um, there are, there are leaders who build the topnotch, you know, flagship sites out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, everyone always mentions White house.org, which used to be, which was a big brag for Duple back in the day. That was, it was originally a droople site. And if we\'re going to recognize leadership and leaders like that, then I think what comes along with that is, is taking the best practices at standards seriously, and hopefully seeing more of those come out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there was a 10 up one, and then I also noticed really all at the same time. So Mike McAllister has, um, Launched Ollie, [00:38:00] um, WordPress tutorials and tools that are really focused on the future of the block editor and full site editing. Um, and there were a couple of others that, um, that popped out. Do you know Alex, the WP Marmite?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I don\'t really, I don\'t know them that well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> but, uh, that one I, no, I, I, I don\'t know Alex very well. Um, I\'ve heard, I\'ve heard of WP Marmite, but I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'ve looked over there a few times. I noticed I, it is like, wow, this is a trend in the, in the last seven to 10 days. Um, new tutorial sites being launched that he has one on per, I think it\'s a performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, have to look back up, up in here. W p Turbo. Um, yeah, which has got, uh, code generators, short code generators, um, familiar things from the past, but, um, gear. Um, reminds me to generate wp, um, or what was that site called? Um, I think that was [00:39:00] it. It, this, yeah, where you can, but it\'s, it\'s got a tutorial component too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, kind of updating those things for, um, performance and the future of. Of the word press editor, um, Jamie Marclin put out a nice, uh, video on how to build quality page layouts in just 10 minutes. right is his, uh, sales line there, which is, which actually there, it, it\'s not easy to make things look good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you need layout, You need to learn some layout, design, skill, basics. Make hash in, um, any kind of , any kind of page builder. And I think people turning to focus on those, um, on those things is a really good sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah. I mean, when you think about it, it\'s, you know, we have great tools and some, some tools don\'t require us to write code, but you still have to have some fundamental skills in place mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>before you can [00:40:00] really have success with them. And I think you know it, I mean, Elementor is a great product, but it doesn\'t necessarily make you a designer by trade. No. Um, just from installing it, I mean, there, there, there\'s, you still have to put in a little bit of work. So these kind of sites are, are nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have because you, those references, you know, can help you become better at what you\'re doing. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And, um, on that note, um, the WordPress, WordPress 6.1 is looking like a really, you\'re gonna be a really cool release. And I noted that. Um, yeah. WordPress, v i p put out a, what they called hot takes, um, on, um, On the value of, of what\'s, what\'s in, um, what\'s in 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That should be noted by, um, their, their audience, their clientele. So I\'m, I\'m, I\'m interested in, in that often, like, you\'re, Okay, so this is directed towards, towards their [00:41:00] clients. This is, you know, very different than the, the, you know, the, um, The broad, mid middle market. Um, and they\'re, they\'re focusing on things like constraints, you know, that you can lock lock blocks, um, which is huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, you know, you only, I, I\'ve only heard agency people and, and freelancers, anyone dealing with clients talking about, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You\'ve got reusable block. You know, we\'ve all found ways probably to new car work by. With reusable blocks that aren\'t, aren\'t locked down or, um, uh, even see Brian Cords mentioned something I\'ve, I\'ve done a few times, although I, I had revisions turned on so I could, I could go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\'s, um, it\'s quite easy to have a second tab open and forget you\'ve made changes in this other tab and then, you know, wipe them out or, or something like that. There\'s a lot, there\'s a lot of little ways. So many more [00:42:00] options in, in Gutenberg can, um, frustrate people whose time, you know, that are, you don\'t want your clients foundering in, in these kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that, that to me is a good sign too, that we\'re, we\'re looking at constraints as, as a positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> Yeah, I mean in the old days we went to great lengths to, to lock things away from clients and now Gutenberg kind of takes that away, when it came out it\'s like, okay, well now they have access to everything and they can do freak all sorts of havocs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the ability to lock things down is, you know, is, is key for the future, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Anything else we should throw on the, on the, on the deck or,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> I think that was about it. Busy week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> No, it seems not. Not, not. No one got acquired. No major, huge business things, but, um, and still trying to digest the [00:43:00] implications of all, all the new, uh, w w commerce, hosted w commerce platforms that are, are rolling out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s, that\'s a big deal. Uh, but yeah, another time another conversation all. Well, thanks for, uh, thanks for joining me again, and we can, uh, do a few more roundups like this, uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karkovack:</strong> now and then. Thank you for having me.

The previews now appear on block themes that include style variations. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Themes that have more variations than what fits in the space beneath the preview pane will display all variations in a carousel with little arrows to navigate to the next ones. Here&#8217;s an example with the Pixl theme from Automattic that contains seven brightly colored variations:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also possible to see a selected style variation loaded into the theme preview now. Clicking the &#8216;Preview&#8217; button will allow users to scroll and explore the theme with their selected style variation applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These style variations, designed by theme authors and packaged in block themes, help users have a diverse set of approaches to their site design allowing them to find one that aligns with their goals,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored Meta team contributor Steve Dufresne said. &#8220;This feature helps to highlight the flexibility of modern WordPress themes and it’s time to have it baked into the theme directory experience.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new style variation previews are fetched from the themes&#8217; <code>/styles/{variation_name}.json</code> files, so theme authors do not have to do anything to make the previews work. They will automatically display for any theme that includes style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta team contributors are also working on adding the ability to filter the directory for themes with style variations. Dufresne proposed creating a new <code>style-variations</code> theme tag as the simplest route towards implementing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Doing so will allow the active filtering of these themes without needing to make many if any code changes,&#8221; he said in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6545\">ticket</a>&#8216;s description.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;A longer-term solution should look at exposing these features visibly somehow without needing to find the obscured filters that we currently have. This feature should be judged equally with others and therefore, this type of implementation should be better debated and falls out of the scope of this ticket and the immediate need to see themes with style variations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a good observation, as not all WordPress users hunting for themes will know that a tag exists in the Feature Filter. That list is already quite lengthy and not the best user experience for discovering themes with specific features, especially if users don&#8217;t understand what the terms mean.  Theme authors will want to watch this <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6545\">ticket</a>. If the shorter term solution of creating a new <code>style-variations</code> tag is committed, they will need to update their themes with the tag to be included in the filtering.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 15:31:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Post Status: Connect freemium plugins to premium extension sales?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=141363\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4531:\"<div class=\"wp-container-27 wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Justin Labadie\'s wishlist for the WordPress.org plugin repo: <br /><br />1) Ensure all search results are relevant. <br />2) Standardize a Premium product upsell interface. <br />3) Make it possible to show other products by the same author.  </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer eplus-wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">2</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Justin Labadie</strong> from <a href=\"http://slickremix.com/\">SlickRemix</a> left <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/two-key-questions-we-need-to-answer/#comment-492939\">a helpful comment</a> that adds an interesting idea to the mix of possible futures for the wordpress.org plugin repository. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Search results should show peer products, not totally unrelated ones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Confirming <a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\">some problems</a> <strong>Matt Cromwell</strong> has noted about the repository\'s search algorithm, Justin describes how he and his brother <strong>Spencer Labadie</strong> had a plugin there that was &#8220;stacked in the search [results]&#8221; with unrelated plugins showing much higher active installs. Nothing the Labadies tried changed this outcome, so &#8220;After many hours, a few years, and &#8230; little to no growth no matter the hours or money&#8221; they decided to get out of the repo. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-standardize-what-works-for-freemium-premium-plugins-upsells-in-the-back-end\">Standardize what works for freemium/premium plugins: Upsells in the back end</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, Justin says &#8220;almost every free install was a premium extension sale of some kind,&#8221; so they were definitely getting value from the plugin repository and freemium model but on the strength of their own product and sales funnel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With our main plugin we have ways we hook people into purchasing our premium extensions,&#8221; Justin commented. He says there should be &#8220;a standardized way for free plugins to do this.&#8221; Why not standardize what works well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How it could look:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I imagine a hook [where] users installing plugins see extensions offered by the plugins/themes. If we standardize something clean and not overly spammy-looking where devs can hook into that [and] show users what they offer that is premium&#8230;. Not a “Premium plugins store” but simply a page or way to display offerings within the repo that users can choose to click see that would take them to place to purchase. There would also be a similar and standardized way of hooking into displaying [upsells] on the [end user\'s] WordPress install’s backend.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, some kind of &#8220;Here\'s what else we offer&#8221; page or panel would come up during the installation process on each site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Make it easy to find everything contributed by each author or company</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<img width=\"752\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-21-at-7.42.57-AM-752x419.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"not-transparent wp-image-141397\" />This is the only place in the plugin repository where you might (possibly) find all the plugins by a single author/vendor.</div>\n\n\n<p>Currently, it\'s not easy or even truly possible to display all the plugins by a single author in the repo. If they are the only author, or if their account is connected to all their plugins in the repo (and many aren\'t), it is only possible to see all those plugins together on the authors\' own profile pages under their Contribution History\'s &#8220;Plugins&#8221; tab. Company/owner pages that list all contributors and all company products — including themes — would do the most to help WordPress businesses using the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:58:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"WPTavern: WordPress Documentation Team to Host Its First Online Contributor Day, October 25, 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-documentation-team-to-host-its-first-online-contributor-day-october-25-2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2185:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Documentation Team will be <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2022/10/19/the-first-ever-documentation-team-contributor-day-25th-october-2022/\">hosting an online Contributor Day</a> on October 25, 2022, ahead of WordPress&#8217; anticipated 6.1 release the following week. Milana Cap, who has been volunteering with the Documentation team for years and is currently sponsored by XWP, announced the event this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The primary goal is to catch up with a lot of tasks in the team’s backlog but also it&#8217;s an opportunity for all contributors to meet, collaborate in real time, and help onboard all new contributors who need any kind of help,&#8221; Cap said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The virtual event will be the first of its kind for the Documentation team but follows in the footsteps of other contributors teams, including the Polyglots and Accessibility teams, which have hosted wildly successful global events that include contribution and onboarding. These types of virtual gatherings help contributors get connected and put names to faces</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors are encouraged to attend, even if it&#8217;s just for a short time to see what documentation contribution is all about. Cap requested everyone who plans to attend to leave their names on the GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues/527\">issue</a> dedicated to the Contributor Day.

As a large and growing company well positioned in Pune, <a href=\"https://yourstory.com/2020/01/pune-tech-startup-hub-maharashtra-state-innovation-policy/amp\">India\'s tech hub</a>, rtCamp recruits new university graduates but in the spirit of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp\"><strong>BarCamp</strong></a> and the idea of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table_(disambiguation)\">round table</a> (where the &#8220;rt&#8221; comes from), rtLearn mints WordPress professionals from college students, new recruits, &#8220;dropouts, freshers, or people with some work experience.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, rtCamp CEO and Founder <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/member-spotlight-rahul-bansal/\">Rahul Bansal</a></strong> wrote that all their new hires had &#8220;gone through remote training via our rtLearn platform,&#8221; and in two years &#8220;these remote classrooms &#8230; allowed us to blow past the <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/100-rtcampers/\">100-employee mark</a>.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, and rtCamp\'s headcount has about doubled on their path to being fully distributed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rtCamp on-site campus program is a full-time, paid, six-month training course rtCamp draws some employees from. They also have a free, <strong>CC0</strong> master <a href=\"https://learn.rtcamp.com/courses/wordpress-development/\">WordPress Development course</a> anyone can take online. This is an outstanding model for WordPress workforce development, and it would be terrific if other major agencies in the space borrowed from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Compare Plugins Side by Side</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, I\'ve been watching rtCamp\'s <strong><a href=\"https://wpplugincompare.com/\">WordPress Plugin Compare</a></strong> directory evolve as a really helpful site for comparing plugins side-by-side. They keep adding <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/wppc-feature-update-filter/\">more features</a> to assist in comparative analysis. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing Expertise: Personalization </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently published on the rtCamp blog — an unfolding <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/personalization-web-intro/\">series on Personalization</a> geared toward the enterprise. In an upcoming post, they\'ll have a case study involving a WordPress — Salesforce Marketing Cloud integration with user segmentation functionality that empowers marketing teams to create email campaigns connected to personalized landing pages on the WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If case studies, tools, and explainers are your thing, the rtCamp blog is full of treats:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/blog/visual-automation-framework-migration-projects/\">A Visual Automation framework for pixel perfect migration and re-platforming</a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/rtCamp/visual-automation-backstop\">GitHub</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/case-studies/migrating-vinsolutions-kentico-cms-to-wordpress-vip/\">Migrating VinSolutions.com from Kentico CMS to WordPress VIP</a> — a client migration case study where Vinsolutions.com is brought from Kentico CMS to a WordPress VIP multisite environment — while increasing the overall website Core Web Vitals performance by 48%.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elementary: A Block-based Starter Theme</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Available on Github, rtCamp has shared a starter theme for block-based, full-site editing themes with developer-friendly features: <a href=\"https://github.com/rtcamp/theme-elementary\">Elementary</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s solid boilerplate following WordPress coding standards that\'s fully FSE-ready with a baked-in testing framework.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:08:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"Post Status: A Makeover for HelpHub — and you can help the Docs Team on Contributor Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=137716\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://poststatus.com/a-makeover-for-helphub-and-you-can-help-the-docs-team-on-contributor-day/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:764:\"<p>Pretty <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2022/10/19/new-design-for-helphub-in-wordpress-org/\">snazzy new looks</a> coming the the WordPress documentation site!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2022/10/19/new-design-for-helphub-in-wordpress-org/\">New design for HelpHub in WordPress.org</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can help the Docs Team!

At least that makes it easy to summarize the five useful ones here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:101\">Matt Cromwell</a> called for a new and proper discussion in a more appropriate setting where stakeholders can &#8220;start a process of talking publicly and with intention and strategy on what it would look like to have real actionable plugin/theme stats that authors need.&#8221; To that end, Matt proposed closing the Trac discussion:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Let\'s close this ticket as &#8220;wont fix&#8221; and move on to more important and long term strategies that actually benefit the plugin community. The longer we haggle over these ineffective charts, the longer it\'ll take to actually start getting real plugin data that is meaningful.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-unhappy-users-reacting-to-a-bad-release\">Unhappy Users Reacting to a Bad Release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Natalie MacLees</strong> describes <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:30\">monitoring incoming support requests relative to the current number of active installs</a> and any dip in install growth following releases with &#8220;new features&#8221; or &#8220;large changes&#8221; to &#8220;judge whether a change to a plugin was a positive or negative one.&#8221; <strong>Benjamin Intal</strong> echoed this, and previously <strong>Steve Burge</strong> said he has a similar practice.

The commit cited &#8220;insufficient data obfuscation&#8221; but there was no clear communication about when and where this decision had been made. Developers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-plugin-developers-demand-transparency-regarding-the-removal-of-active-install-growth-data\">demanded more transparency</a> around the charts&#8217; removal but received no clear answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple opportunities to communicate the details behind the decision were deliberately forgone, as speculation mounted. Several contributors not directly involved in the conversations prematurely insisted it was removed due to a security or privacy concern, but Samuel Otto Wood has unequivocally confirmed that it was neither of these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent appearance on the <a href=\"https://wpwatercooler.com/wpwatercooler/ep432-solutions-to-the-active-growth-problem/\">WPwatercooler podcast</a>, Wood elaborated on the decision, which he says was made in May through private channels via Slack DMs in a discussion initiated by Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason is really quite simple,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;It was removed because by and large, nobody was using them. Nobody was using the chart itself.  By and large, the chart was not useful to the majority, and it didn’t really fit the purpose we had for it, that we had in mind when we implemented it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood said the active growth chart was intended to just show growth or decline of a plugin on a weekly basis, but the data wasn&#8217;t working as intended:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>People wanted that feedback on whether plugin’s growing, whether it’s shrinking, et cetera. And that’s valuable information for developers to have,  it’s valuable information users to know. But it really wasn’t working as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data that it provided was a percentage based data, and it was a very weak percentage based data. So by and large, the majority of use of that data was people scraping the data and using it to work backwards to the exact quote, exact numbers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was entirely the problem was that people were largely using it to get those numbers. Now, that’s not itself bad, but a, the reverse math didn’t work. It was wrong for a number of reasons, mainly because we were doing such a way obfuscating the data in such a way that it made that number wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Actually, it’s kind of funny. It actually always gave numbers a bit too high, so it was giving people the wrong impression. Third, it really, people trusted it as an active number, as a number of active cells to the point where, to the point where they, they relied on it to make decisions and things like that. It was not a good idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Otto was not involved in working on the project at the time, he was privy to the discussion and relayed some of the details:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I read through all that discussion and we worked, they worked on it for a long, Scott and several people tried various things before removing it. They adjusted the values, they adjusted numbers. They, they went through a ridiculous amount of iteration and in the end, none of it worked. People were still using it even though it was giving them basically garbage. So finally removing it was the only thing to do. We did have a plan for replacing it. We just didn’t have a plan for replacing it immediately. Nevertheless, giving them active install count numbers that are wrong is more harmful, we felt, to both users and developers interests than simply not giving them at all. So that’s why it was removed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The concern podcast host Sé Reed and guest Matt Cromwell highlighted was that the decision was communicated in such a way that it suggested it was security related. Since it was not a sensitive security or privacy issue, Reed asked why was it handled in a private chat instead of the meta channel when the decision had such a profound impact on developers being able to track the trajectory of their plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the inaccuracy of the charts was well-known to those more intimately acquainted with the problem, Wood said its removal was &#8220;not quite the big deal&#8221; that everyone else ended up perceiving it to be. They did not anticipate the firestorm the charts&#8217; removal would create in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">trac ticket</a> where developers were pleading to have them restored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The physical visual chart itself is not so instrumental to the way I operate things,&#8221; GiveWP founder Matt Cromwell said. &#8220;But it’s the act of removing it without any conversation whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And what does that mean for the long run of data about plugins on.org and the viability of their, of us, continuing to have them? That’s the real question. It’s an indicator of an underlying problem that isn’t getting better.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident has sparked discussions about <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/what-should-plugin-developers-expect-from-wordpress/\">what kind of partnership plugin developers should expect from WordPress.org</a>, and whether it&#8217;s time they looked for support from one another instead of the platform, as Eric Karkovack suggested on The WP Minute. In light of plugin developers losing more valuable data that hasn&#8217;t been replaced, Alex Denning, managing director of Ellipsis, a digital marketing agency, makes the case that <a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/\">WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>. He contends that new WordPress plugins are not passing the 100k, 500k , or 1m+ install thresholds and the directory isn’t giving plugins organic reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focus of the ticket has changed from calling on WordPress.org to bring back the active growth charts to be more about brainstorming helpful plugin stats and insights that plugin developers would like to see. It is still receiving angry and frustrated comments from developers who believe the data should belong to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I cannot emphasize enough that conversations about what to replace the active growth chart with should be happening in a public Slack channel or on a Trac ticket,&#8221; Equalize Digital CEO Amber Hinds said. &#8220;This data should belong to the community and the community should be able to participate in deciding how (or not) to display it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons that purportedly necessitate obfuscation have not been clearly explained, but many participants in the discussion have urged WordPress.org to simply publish the raw data so it can be accessed and processed independently of the platform. @Starbuck <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:108\">suggests</a> the community would then be able to create sites that render the data in meaningful and interesting ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developers want far more data than was previously available. Hinds <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:105\">requested</a> an assortment of data points that may or may not be possible:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Things that tell us if our readme and other ranking factors are on track:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Number of searches (or impressions) for target keywords</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average ranking for target keywords for timeframe (month)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Conversion rates from impression to install for target keywords</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Things that tell us if we may have a problem with our plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Number of deactivations per timeframe (month, preferably week)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Number of deletions per timeframe (month, preferably week)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Average time from activation to deactivation or deletion</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Things for better testing of releases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Top 20 plugins also active</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Top 20 themes also active</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PHP versions (percentage)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPress versions (percentage)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Atarim CEO Vito Peleg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitoPeleg/status/1577784069596876800\">suggested</a> some other tools for monitoring growth/decline, to which Matt Mullenweg responded that some of the ideas were &#8220;very doable:&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Time to churn (to deactivate) signals good/bad onboarding, UI/UX</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Repeat installs &#8211; how many users (anonymized) install on multiple sites for community opp &amp; advocacy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Time to result: dev can choose 1 single hook to trigger as “result” and the calculation checks how long from install to get there. By changing the placement of the hook devs can optimize entire flows.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Inner page tracker: which/how many inner plugin pages users visit</li>\n\n\n\n<li>PHP ver distribution, general country-based installs, active install to review ratio</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood confirmed that the active install growth charts are not coming back in their previous form and that the endpoint people were scraping before will remain disabled. He said those involved in the private discussion are monitoring the Trac ticket for feedback.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What’s going to happen is, that the active install count instead of being rounded to the nearest digit is going to be changed,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;I don’t know the exact break points cutoffs, but as an example show individual up to 50, then round to nearest 10 until thousand and nearest hundred until 10,000, for example. So that we are making the active install count much more fine grained than it has been. So in that sense, yes, we’re giving you the data. It’s not going to be exact numbers, but it’s going be much better than it was before. We’re still working on doing that.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 04:38:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"Post Status: November: Register to speak at WordFest Live — and come to WordPress Accessibility Day\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=137720\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://poststatus.com/register-to-speak-at-wordfest-live/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:840:\"<ul><li>Coming up on <strong>November 18</strong>, <strong>WordFest Live</strong> will once again <em>“support and promote positive well-being and mental health within remote working communities.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.wordfest.live/2022/november/\">REGISTER →</a></li><li>And don\'t forget <strong>WordPress Accessibility Day</strong> on <strong>November 2-3</strong>! <strong><a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\">REGISTER →</a></strong></li><li>Then on <strong>November 21</strong>, it\'s <strong>Alicia St. Rose</strong> of <strong>WP With Heart </strong>giving a <strong>Meetup</strong> talk on <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-accessibility-meetup-group/events/287994860/\">Being an A11y with Your Content</a>.</li></ul>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 03:37:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: #47 – Adam Silverstein on the State of Images in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=138682\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/47-adam-silverstein-on-the-state-of-images-in-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57784:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern.

Adam is a WordPress core comitter, where he works to fix bugs and improve modern web capabilities. As a developer relations engineer in the content ecosystem team at Google, he works to invigorate the open web by empowering and educating developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US he gave a presentation entitled images on the web, past, present and future. In it, he outlined his thoughts on where the web is going in terms of support for different image formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside text images are the bedrock of webpages. We browse the internet and expect pages to have images of all forms. Photos, illustrations, charts and images to convey additional meaning to the text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do the images actually get on the page? WordPress makes handling images pretty easy, and Adam explains what happens when you upload an image to the media library and then display it on a page or post in a browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the fact that different image sizes are created automatically by WordPress, which can be used in a variety of contexts across your website. You&#8217;ve likely heard of many of them. But perhaps you have not thought about which image format belongs where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with code, the technology behind images does not stand still. New image formats are being created all the time, and are being supported at differing rates by the major browser vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, we typically used JPEG. GIF or PNG files to display images on our websites, but there&#8217;s good reason to think about adopting other defaults in the near future. We discussed some of these new formats, such as WebP, AVIF and JPEG XL, and find out how they are speeding up website loading times because of their smaller file sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into how you can optimize your images and how plugins and SaaS solutions can reduce the size of your files before or after you upload them to your WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam has some good advice about a topic which is becoming increasingly important, page load time. And if you&#8217;ve never given the serious thought, this is a great podcast episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically when we record the podcast, there&#8217;s not a lot of background noise. But that&#8217;s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I&#8217;ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artifacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope that you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Adam Silverstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Adam Silverstein. Did I get that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> You did. That&#8217;s the way I like to pronounce it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Perfect. Adam is here because he did a presentation at Word Camp US this year. What was the presentation about Adam?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It was images on the web, past, present, and future. So kind of like a history of images and also what&#8217;s coming in the future for modern image formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. We&#8217;ll delve into that in a moment, but before we do, would you just give us the two minute potted history of Adam. How it is that you&#8217;ve come to speak at a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure. Yeah. I mean, I used to build sites in, uh, Dreamweaver. Then I discovered WordPress as a way to let my clients be able to edit their content. Then one day I decided I should contribute back to WordPress. I became super involved in Core and help rewrite revisions for 3.6. Eventually, I became a core comitter. And, worked at agency, 10up, for quite a while, and then eventually wound up on the CMS team at Google. Working on the web platform, trying to make the web platform better. And I still work on WordPress quite a bit in that role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Google seemed to be doing a lot more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Absolutely. Since about 2017 when they started showing up at every WordCamp. And also they have that first party plugin Site Kit, which is their own plugin that&#8217;s very well supported that connects your WordPress site to Google Services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we spoke to Felix a few episodes ago. So, if you&#8217;re into Site Kit and things like that, you can search for the Felix Arntz episode. But we&#8217;re here to talk about images today. And I&#8217;m going to lead off with something which is going to make me sound incredibly ignorant, and apologize for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is simply this. When I visit a webpage or I&#8217;m building a website, images basically just magically appear. They&#8217;re on my computer. I see that there&#8217;s an image, there&#8217;s a file name and a file format, JPEG and so on and so forth. But I honestly have no idea how the browser makes the image appear. I don&#8217;t know what the mystery voodoo that&#8217;s going on in the background to turn a piece of code, I&#8217;m guessing, into something visible on the screen. So ridiculous as it may sound. How do we even get images on the web? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, so it&#8217;s not a stupid question because it&#8217;s it&#8217;s incredibly complex, actually how browsers deal with images. But at a very basic level, typically there&#8217;s a lot of ways images actually appear on webpages, because it could be in your css or you could load it dynamically with JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in a normal HTML context, you have an image tag, and that image tag has a url. When the browser first gets your HTML page, it goes through a parsing phase where it tries to decipher what all the elements that I&#8217;m gonna need to construct this visual page. What CSS do I need, what images do I need?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it goes through the HTML and each time it encounters an image. It makes another request back to your web server, that&#8217;s running WordPress. And then that image is brought back to the browser. Now that&#8217;s a binary format, that image. So the browser also has to have a capability of decoding that image. That&#8217;s where support for different image formats come in, and all the browsers support all the formats that we&#8217;re used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then there&#8217;s these more modern formats that maybe aren&#8217;t supported. That&#8217;s kind of the simple version of it, is the browser finds the reference that you have on your HTML. Goes out and retrieves it, just like it does any asset, and then it decompresses it and puts it on your display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If I was to look at the binary code, which made up the image. Which I presume is possible? Is it just a combination of letters, numbers, and characters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:46] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> I mean, it&#8217;s binary encoding, so I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t actually know what, it&#8217;s eight bit probably, or 16 bit encoding. But you&#8217;ll have, typically at the first bites of an image will be like a header block. That defines what the image is, the meta information about the image. And then you&#8217;ll have the actual data of the image. And that&#8217;s in chunks. And it depends on how, what image compression format you&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But typically images are compressed. So you have some information about that compression in the header, and then you have the chunks that make up the file. But it wouldn&#8217;t be something, if you looked at it, it wouldn&#8217;t make any sense to a human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:18] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It would just be like binary data, just a bunch of numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It kind of reminds me a little bit of TCPIP packets, you know, it&#8217;s surrounded with metadata to give, well, in this case it would be the, the OS stack. But, to give the browser information about what&#8217;s coming down the pipe in the next moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:32] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So how big it is, what the dimensions are, and so on and so forth. And then each little bit will render I guess a pixel or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:40] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Exactly. You could think of it that way. But you know, in a lot of these compression engines, it&#8217;s actually like an eight by eight block, and then there&#8217;s more detail. It&#8217;s very complicated really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even the thing about, like, I very much simplified the how the webpage is loaded because the browser has to decide which resources to load first and which to prioritize. And also just think about an image tag. Image tags now typically have a source set attribute, which indicates which size image we want, depending on the break point that we&#8217;re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the browser has to figure out that information as well. It&#8217;s quite complex and people have written whole articles on it. So if you&#8217;re interested in it, there&#8217;s, like in my talk, I&#8217;ve got like a links document and there&#8217;s some links that I&#8217;ve put out to like how browsers work. It is very interesting to understand and I think it, like, can help inform, just the more you understand that, the more you understand why trying to optimize performance is so complex.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really does amaze me, and these days, images on the connection at least that I have in my home, seem to load more or less instantaneously, but I remember going back in the day when it was dial up, this laborious line by line creation of the image. You could watch the image load and it would just sort of generate going down. Do you remember seeing all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:51] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> You could see it loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You could actually see the image loading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> And you could simulate that, you know, in Chrome using the throttling, in Chrome dev. But the other thing to remember is that, we&#8217;re a little privileged here. We have very high speed connections. We have high powered devices, but if you look at the world as a whole, that&#8217;s really not the case. There&#8217;s still a lot of people in the world who are using low powered, they&#8217;re using a phone, it&#8217;s not like a smartphone, like an iPhone. It&#8217;s a very low powered device. So even just the decoding of the images can be expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the bandwidth thing,. Some people, a lot of places in the world, people are paying for bandwidth. So the more bandwidth you use. So they may have images turned off or they may be in a low data mode. A lot of phones support a low data mode where they&#8217;ll try to reduce the amount of data that they&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. One of the things we introduced recently into Word Press Core is native lazy loading of images. So this is something we used to do in JavaScript, but now is built into browsers. And what it does is it prevents the images that are off your view port from loading until you start scrolling down. Before you reach them, when you start scrolling, as you get closer to the where they&#8217;re gonna appear, then it will load those images. So, of course this is great for saving resource because when your page loads, if it&#8217;s a long page with many images, you don&#8217;t have to load all those images unless and until the user starts scrolling down the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this sounds great, and especially at, in a high speed connection environment, it works great. But someone gave the feedback during the process of introducing this, that they work on a low bandwidth connection. And what they like to do is start loading the page and then they switch to another tab and they wait till everything loads and then they come back and they read all their content. But with lazy loading, it doesn&#8217;t work very well because suddenly they scroll a little bit and now they have to wait for another image to load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m imagining that typical user is not browsing the web in that way. But that is an interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:31] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is an interesting case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:32] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> What it just brings up is that you really have to think about your users. When you&#8217;re trying to optimize your site, it&#8217;s not just optimizing for yourself, it&#8217;s optimizing for your users. And that&#8217;s why having real user metrics is so valuable. Collecting actual field data about how people are experiencing your website, as opposed to doing lab tests like we are running lighthouse or page speed insights to try to figure out like, oh, how&#8217;s my site performing? That gives you one metric, but that doesn&#8217;t tell you how people actually in the wild experience your website. If most people have low bandwidth connections, that&#8217;s gonna be really different than what you might get from a local test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just pivot a little bit and talk about the different types of images there are. I would imagine almost everybody is familiar with the regular, the usual suspects, shall we say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:12] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You know, the JPEGs and the PNGs, and don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s how you pronounce it. Some people I&#8217;ve heard say, ping. But I always say PNG and I say GIF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:20] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes, and I say GIF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, yeah, but there&#8217;s all of these. There&#8217;s more, which we&#8217;ll get onto later. But presumably there&#8217;s dozens more that are not typically used on the web. Why have these formats evolved over time? Why don&#8217;t we just have one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:33] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right, that&#8217;s a great question, I mean, uh, the GIF format came out 35 years ago, and it pretty much did everything we needed to do, right? It could display images, it had animation, it had transparency. Wow, like images on the web. That was actually a big deal at the time. But there were some limitations. It only had 256 colors. So if you wanted to make a photograph, you had to dither the colors and it only had lossless compression, which is not really that efficient. You know, you maybe get 10 or 15%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also had copyright issues. The LZW compression algorithm that was in GIF, there were copyright holders. Big corporations and the free software movement didn&#8217;t feel that they could trust this format. That&#8217;s part of why PNG came about 15 years ago, was as a response to the limitations of the compression algorithm, the copyrights. Of course PNG also added alpha transparency, which is an improved version of transparency because you can define opacity on a per pixel basis, and this lets you create an image with a transparent background that&#8217;s got like smooth edges. Like GIF images with transparent have those like blocky edges. But with a PNG, you can create a gradual fading to opacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was a big improvement. So it actually added a really useful feature. It&#8217;s great for product images, PNGs. Of course, JPEG introduced lossy compression, which let you just tune your compression to whatever level you wanted. You could get 10 times smaller images that still look good, which was really important at that time. But you could also fine tune that if you were a photographer and you wanted higher quality, you could choose that higher quality setting. That was really unique. GIF didn&#8217;t have that, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And SVG of course is the fourth kind of major one that we use on the web. And that&#8217;s just like very different. It&#8217;s for illustrations. It&#8217;s vector based instead of raster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a file format isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It is, it&#8217;s actually XML, think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:14] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Unfortunately it also includes scripting, which means that we don&#8217;t support it in core because of the security concerns. But it&#8217;s also very specific to like illustration type formats. That&#8217;s where it really shines. It has some big advantages. It can be styled with css. You can&#8217;t do that with other image formats. What I&#8217;m trying to get at is that each format introduced new capabilities that were important at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started to talk about modern image formats, which I include WebP in, even though it&#8217;s 12 years old at this point. What&#8217;s really cool about WebP is, it kind of combines all the features that came before. So it has the alpha transparency of PNG, but it also has the lossy compression of JPEG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So suddenly you can take a transparent PNG and you get 80% improved compression, by making it into a transparent WebP. You still get all the features you need, the alpha transparency, but the compression is lossy now, which is impossible for we didn&#8217;t have a format that had both lossy and alpha transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WebP kind of is like, essentially trying to be all the things you need. Like if we had started with WebP, we probably wouldn&#8217;t have ever needed another format, because it supports animation, it supports lossy and lossless compression, it supports alpha transparency. It also has better compression than JPEG, like 30% better on average for the same quality. So it&#8217;s a big improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s a couple other formats that are upcoming, I would say. AVIF is probably the next one. It was just, support was just announced in Safari for AVIF. So Edge is the only remaining browser, major browser, that doesn&#8217;t support it. And the big promise of AVIF really over WebP is not on features, it&#8217;s just the compression that it achieves. And it&#8217;s able to achieve a 50% improvement over JPEG. So it&#8217;s very promising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the one other one that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s kind of coming up that&#8217;s even newer is called JPEG XL. And this is from the same group that made JPEG and it&#8217;s just like a way, way better compression, like AVIF, but it has more affinity to JPEG so it works better with existing JPEGs. Like, it can losslessly recode existing JPEGs. The problem with JPEG XL, at least right now, is that it&#8217;s so new that it&#8217;s not really supported anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a couple things that have happened. There&#8217;s been a lot of advances in compression over the years. A lot of them actually related to video, because we&#8217;ve, we started streaming video on the web and a lot of investment went into making those compressions better. And then those, like the AVI video format is the basis, the same compression, forms the basis of AVIF, hence the naming similarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the WebP, the history of, of like where that compression algorithm came from, but the, the goal was to create something that was better than JPEG. Higher quality at the same size, or smaller size at the same quality. You can think of it in, in either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. I remember back in the day, I hate to age myself in this way, but I remember Internet Explorer six, and the enormous fun that we had with trying to get transparency and the sort of kludges that you had to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> To get it wo work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, a little JavaScript snippet so that you could get transparency and so on. And so that tells me that, at certain points in. history, certain image formats have not been available in browsers. Broadly speaking, there&#8217;s probably three or four browsers that the majority of people on Earth are using these days. We know what they&#8217;re called. But do they support all of these? Really, the reason I&#8217;m asking this question is, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;ve got a website and I&#8217;ve got 10,000 images on website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I now have learned that there&#8217;s a potentially 30% benefit in getting them rendered as, let&#8217;s say, WebP or, or any of the other ones that you mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Would you say it&#8217;s worthwhile doing that work and re rendering them as, let&#8217;s say, WebP or something like that? Or should I just carry on and do the new formats for the new images? Or like I said, go back and redo them all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:50] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it probably depends on how much actual traffic you get on those older posts. I think a lot of people have older posts on their site that get very little traffic, and then I would say it&#8217;s probably not worth updating it. With the filter that we have in place in core to control the output, you can use regenerate images and regenerate all your old images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And get that WebP benefit, like switch from JPEG to WebP for your old files. There are some caveats there. You need to make sure that the images have been inserted from the editor so that they&#8217;re actually replaced in the HTML. Because if you&#8217;re changing all your image file names, you don&#8217;t want to have broken images in your old posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordPress does do that on the fly, where we, if you insert an image from the editor, then it has like a WP image class name. So we can identify the source image and then we go and we, we build that source set into the HTML by looking at the metadata about the image. So when you do that regenerate images, it updates the metadata and therefore you&#8217;ll get the new images even in your old posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s not guaranteed. If you have really old posts or they don&#8217;t have that WP class, and then for some reason, because you maybe built it with a page builder tool, for example, that doesn&#8217;t include those, there are scenarios where that could break your images. And all the regenerate images plugins have options around this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like um, WPCLI, you know, you can have it not delete the old images. So if you have URLs that are still out there referring to the old images, that&#8217;ll work. Or another example is you might have a third party site that has embedded your image. If you&#8217;re okay with that and you don&#8217;t want to break that, then you want to avoid changing your file name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:13] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> So it depends a lot on your use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Caveat emptor really. Just give it a bit of thought. In terms of the browsers. What is the support like for, well obviously we know that the usual suspects that we mentioned at the beginning. The age old ones, GIFs and PNGs and JPEGs, that&#8217;s fine?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What about the other ones? What about the WebPs and the AVIFs and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:33] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah. So the great place to check is the, can I use website, right? They&#8217;ve got all the details but, right now WebP is supported in all the browsers, very widely supported. The only exception is older versions of Safari, and Safari support actually depends on the underlying operating system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this means that users have to upgrade to, I think it&#8217;s two versions ago of MacOS. So there is a small percentage of users out there that have this older Safari version that won&#8217;t load WebPs correctly. It&#8217;s actually very difficult to tell how many because there&#8217;s a bug, in like one of the subsequent versions of Safari where the user agent string misreported the OS version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So between a couple versions of Safari and iOS or MacOS, you actually can&#8217;t tell the difference from logs. And so we don&#8217;t have good data about that in the wild, but from the data that we have, we think it&#8217;s between 1 and 2% of browser users in the world that don&#8217;t support WebP currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Dare I ask, was there any politics in Safari not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Supporting it? I don&#8217;t think so. I mean, people say, oh, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a Google format. Like it&#8217;s an open source format that Google developed. But it is widely supported across a huge number of applications. There&#8217;s a lot of criticism of Safari for under investing in web capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if this really falls into that. I do think that Apple as a company has a vested interest in keeping their app ecosystem more powerful than the web ecosystem. So I think there&#8217;s sort of some natural tension there, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t blame the Safari team. My expectation is the Safari team is all on board on making the web better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a big corporation and there&#8217;s different interests. So there could be some political part to it, but I, not that I&#8217;m aware of. Safari, just to continue like the AVIF is sort of the next one. And Safari did just recently announce AVIF support. I think they&#8217;re just slower to adopt some things than other browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess if I&#8217;m using WordPress and images are a key component. I do want to be really mindful that, that number, the percentage. So you think at the moment WebP is about 98% of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> 98 to 99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, at some point the Rubicon got crossed and you can say to. yourself, that&#8217;s fine. The percentage is easily high enough. I can confidently use WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:35] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How about the other formats? Also just staying on the WebP, let&#8217;s do that bit. first. Would you recommend people to shift over to WebP henceforth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:44] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Or is there, is there a good reason to stay with the older formats?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> The only reason I would say not use WebP would be is if you knew most of your users were all on older Safari versions. Or you sent newsletters out to Windows users using Outlook, which is one other use case. We know that doesn&#8217;t support WebP. But this is like old versions of Outlook running on Windows. Not modern outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess at some point you just have to take the plunge and say there&#8217;s enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, Well, and we do have a support shim for Safari. So in the browser, if the page is loading WebPs, we add this little bit of JavaScript, it&#8217;s a tiny little bit that does feature detection. So it can actually detect whether the browser supports WebP. And at that point, if it doesn&#8217;t support WebP, we can actually swap the images and use the JPEGs that we do have available, We use like the next largest size that&#8217;s available. And with the current implementation, that would be either your original image or like the one of the H, high definition images that WordPress automatically creates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there will be, like, the primary sizes would be WebP, but there would be still be some available sizes in JPEG. If nothing else, the original image. So that means that your Safari users will still see images, they&#8217;ll just get a slower experience. So 1% of users will get a degraded experience. 99% users will get an improved experience, and then it&#8217;s up to you to decide whether it&#8217;s worth it. But at least those Safari users won&#8217;t be totally left out in the dark. They&#8217;ll still be able to see your images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really curious. For some reason I have this atrophy and I&#8217;ve known that WebP was at about 98. And I put several images online each and every week, maybe a, a dozen or so. And for some reason I always export them as a JPEG. I haven&#8217;t managed in my own mind to say, this is now the moment. I think you&#8217;ve convinced me. I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:20] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah. But I mean, in my opinion, like that really shouldn&#8217;t be up to users to understand that or figure that out. I mean, if you&#8217;re very technical, if you&#8217;re a photographer, maybe. But for the average WordPress user, they don&#8217;t know what image format they&#8217;re using. So this is why, it should be like a core capability where it just happens for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Okay, so WebP, that&#8217;s great. But you, you mentioned a couple of others. There was JPEG, I wanted to say JPEG 2. What was it, JPEG?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:46] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> JPEG XL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:50] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> And there&#8217;s a bunch of JPEGs actually. There was one called JPEG 2000 that you might remember that was pushed by the JPEG foundation, or organization, for a while, and that was never adopted. But yeah, let&#8217;s talk about those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So they, they&#8217;re presumably growing in use? Are they safe to use at the moment? Would you recommend, for example, my website using those image formats? Or Should I wait a little bit longer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:07] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Probably wait a little bit longer, yeah. Safari doesn&#8217;t support it yet. They&#8217;ve announced support, it&#8217;s coming out and whenever the next Mac OS comes out, I think it&#8217;s like this week or something. Or it&#8217;s soon. It&#8217;s very soon. But that means that they&#8217;re just starting support so you probably want to wait till a significant number of users are actually on that version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:23] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Which in the Apple ecosystem actually happens pretty quickly. People generally, you know, there&#8217;s a very large percentage of users who will go to the next OS version very quickly. It doesn&#8217;t cost anything. And it&#8217;s like they&#8217;ve proven that it&#8217;s safe. Um, they have a pretty good uptick rate. So yeah, I mean, the only way, if you really wanted to take advantage of AVIF, we have a couple options. One is using an image CDN. So the advantage of an image CDN is that, it can actually negotiate the format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when browsers make a request for an image, they actually can indicate in their header, in their request headers, which formats they&#8217;re capable of decoding. And that means that the image CDN can be like, oh, you, you take AVIF? I&#8217;ll give you AVIF. That&#8217;s the best one that we have. But if it doesn&#8217;t support AVIF, okay, how about WebP? You support that? Okay. No, you don&#8217;t support any of those? We&#8217;ll give you the JPEG version. The CDN can use this capability negotiation at header time, to deliver the best image. And also they can resize the image to exactly meet the size specifications of your HTML, which WordPress doesn&#8217;t do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress generates several sizes, and then we pick the best size that&#8217;s the closest to the one that you&#8217;ve put on your page. And also we can&#8217;t do the header negotiation because we don&#8217;t handle the image requests. Those are handled by Apache or whatever web server you&#8217;re running Nginx, you know. You have a web server running, it actually handles the image request directly. WordPress has no involvement in that whatsoever. And there are plugins that do this, the only way that you can interact with that is, is using like htaccess. There are some ways to do it, but there generally outside of cores scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Typically, would this CDN be the kind of thing that you would negotiate with your hosting provider?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:56] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Some hosting providers provide it. There&#8217;s of course all kinds of third party CDNs. Jetpack provides an image CDN as one example. Some of them are free, some of them are paid. I think every major CDN has a WordPress plugin that will directly integrate. So you don&#8217;t really have to do much to set it up, maybe put your login or your key in or something. So I would say like, if you can hook up with an image CDN, then you&#8217;re sort of automatically able to take advantage of the latest versions of images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah that sounds like the way to do it, if you can stretch to that. That sounds like the best way because you can just forget about it. Everything will be taken care of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Exactly. If you have a reason that you can&#8217;t do it or there&#8217;s a cost associated with it. Your best bet is probably to stick with WebP for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Because that is so widely supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> On that point, are there particular types of images that you would recommend given a certain scenario? So, for example, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m taking wildlife photography. Fairly specific example, but there&#8217;s an awful lot on the image. There&#8217;s dark areas, light areas. Lots of color. Let&#8217;s say for example, I&#8217;m creating some graphic design and it&#8217;s fairly plain, it&#8217;s text based. There&#8217;s not a lot going on in there. Is there a preferred way in, at least in your mind, or is it always WebP?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:58] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> I mean, there are definitely cases where WebP like really performs better, and there&#8217;s cases where JPEG performs almost as well as WebP I guess. And even there are images where the WebP will be slightly larger than the JPEG, in certain cases to get the same quality. You know, I would say certainly if you&#8217;re doing illustration, something that&#8217;s like a line art, then if it could be an SVG, that&#8217;s probably gonna be your most efficient format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But other than that, I think probably WebP is gonna win out on average, right? So you can look at specific images and find that maybe one would be better as JPEG, one would be better as WebP. But in general, if you take all your image is an aggregate, you&#8217;re gonna be way better off going with WebP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the exception to that would be like, is if you are a photographer and what you&#8217;re showing on your website is your photography, and you want it to be like the absolute highest quality. You maybe already have changed the default quality that WordPress uses, and maybe you just want to stick with JPEG so that you know that you&#8217;re getting exactly what you&#8217;re used to. There is a visual difference between JPEG and WebP and, you know, there&#8217;s all these tools that, that they use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about it a little bit in my talk about, how do you measure quality? It&#8217;s a very subjective thing actually. There&#8217;s algorithms, so when I&#8217;m talking about how do you measure quality, So let&#8217;s say you take an image and you compress it with a JPEG and then you&#8217;re comparing it to something you&#8217;ve compressed with WebP and you say, oh, the WebP is smaller. That&#8217;s great. But it&#8217;s not that great if also the quality is lower, right? If the quality is the same and the file smaller, you win. But if the file smaller and the quality is degraded, then is that really something you want? So that you have to look at both quality and file size as two parts of the same discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s very interesting how we think about quality. I think, I have a slide in my talk where I have two images and there are very different compression qualities, but you actually can&#8217;t tell the difference on the screen because it&#8217;s blurry and you&#8217;re looking at a screen from 30 feet away. And the point is that it matters, the context where you&#8217;re gonna be viewing that matters. If it&#8217;s a little thumbnail, you&#8217;re not going to really matter if it&#8217;s like some pixels that are off. But if you&#8217;re looking at like that big gorgeous wildlife photography and you&#8217;re a photographer, you want the best possible quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess it&#8217;s a case by case basis, isn&#8217;t It?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:00] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong>Just suddenly occurred to me that we didn&#8217;t talk about how WordPress deals with images. We have the media library. I would imagine that&#8217;s how most people interact with their images on WordPress. You go into the media library and you upload things, drag them in and what have you. But there&#8217;s all sorts of wizardry going on right at that moment where you pull the image in for the first time. And, potentially people listening to this, they won&#8217;t know about that. So.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:20] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you able to run through that quickly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:22] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sure, so when you upload your image to WordPress. You&#8217;re uploading your original image, and then WordPress is gonna create a series of subsidized images. By default it has I think four, it&#8217;s actually six sizes built in. Four that you can see in the settings, or three that you can see in the settings screens. Thumbnail, medium and large. There&#8217;s also a medium large size that we added. And then there&#8217;s also two HDMI, high definition screen sizes, that are like even larger than the large size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you upload your image, WordPress will go through this kind of crunching phase where it generates all of these subsidized images, and then those can be used later on the front end, depending on your context. So if it&#8217;s a thumbnail image, it&#8217;s gonna use that really small image. If it&#8217;s a larger image, it&#8217;ll use the larger one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we sort of pre-create these images when you upload. That process uses, uh, one of two libraries on the backend that tie into your web server. One&#8217;s called LibGD, which is now built into php. And the other one&#8217;s called ImageMagick, or people call it Image Magic. That&#8217;s like the GUI for it. And both of those libraries are available in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have built in image handling classes for them. I will say you can also extend the image library to add your own image handling class, but I&#8217;m not aware of specific implementations. But those are sort of the two that we support out of the box. And they&#8217;re very popular and common in php. Like I said, GD&#8217;s built into php now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those libraries may or may not support different formats. So getting back to your question of which format is supported. In order to be able to use AVIF with WordPress, we really need that server support. because if the server can&#8217;t read AVIF, if that means when you upload an AVIF file or you upload a JPEG and you&#8217;re trying to output AVIF, it can&#8217;t do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t know how to do that. So until we get to PHP 8.1, which supports AVIF, we&#8217;re probably not going to be able to support directly AVIF in WordPress. So there&#8217;s that server dependency that you have. And also, just to add a little wrinkle to that is that, GD supports WebP or, you know, Imagemagick supports AVIF, but only if it&#8217;s built with that. So literally at compile time, someone has to build the web server, right? It&#8217;s written in C or whatever assembly, like whatever code it&#8217;s written in, and then someone has to compile and they have to decide, am I including the AVIF i library? Am I including the WebP library? And so whether you have support for those depends on your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what is their hosting stack, what is the distribution that they&#8217;re using? It&#8217;s a wide variety of things out there. But yeah, that&#8217;s the general process. You upload, the images get generated, and then, when you insert the image into your post WordPress will use all of those images. They&#8217;ll use it in the source set to build out the responsive design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> As with all things WordPress there&#8217;s plugins that step in and do additional features. I mean you can code this yourself but you know, you can create other image sizes that WordPress will create on the fly, soon as you, you know, you crunch an image. Yeah, but also there&#8217;s this curious third party industry of image s smushing, I want to call it. You know where, when it&#8217;s uploaded, and I believe also WordPress itself now has a maximum, you know, if you&#8217;ve got a vanilla install of WordPress there&#8217;s a, what is it? What&#8217;s the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:15] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It&#8217;s It&#8217;s like a max threshold size for image uploads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That, I suppose is a useful thing to talk about. The idea that, okay, so you&#8217;ve got this brand new beautiful camera, which is taking images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:27] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Sixteen megapixels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, and honestly you&#8217;ve got a 10 megabyte image but you&#8217;re intending to display it as a thumbnail in the corner of your post or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:34] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The intention, therefore, from these third party plugins and, and what have you, is to take that image and just reduce it. Make it teeny tiny. Why do we do that? What&#8217;s the benefit to begin there? You talked about bandwidth and all of that earlier. Is that the only reason that we&#8217;re doing, it&#8217;s just to save on bandwidth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> And to speed up the loading of the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> So, and just to Expand on that. It&#8217;s not really just about the speed of the page, but it&#8217;s about the experience of your users visiting your website. If you have slow images that are too large for what you need, then you are giving your users a poor experience. There&#8217;s all kinds of studies that show that by improving the loading time and responsiveness of your website, you get better results. So whatever those goals may be, conversions into newsletter subscribers or people who purchase products, or someone who reads more than one article on your website. Those things are all enhanced by having a better user experience. And so if we&#8217;re talking about optimizing images, we&#8217;re really talking about creating a better user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re wearing your Google t-shirt today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you know you&#8217;re doing all all the right things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:37] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Google google loves open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are not on the search team, so maybe this question is not gonna be one that&#8217;s right in your wheelhouse, but I&#8217;m gonna ask it anyway. SEO and search engine results. I&#8217;m presuming there is a benefit because you know, in the last couple of years we&#8217;ve all been thinking about Core Web Vitals and that&#8217;s been a big push from Google, and everybody&#8217;s taken that very seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:56] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, you know, is there a benefit to your search position, should you take the time to do images right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:04] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yes, and I&#8217;ll say that it&#8217;s only really a very small benefit. Really what gets you the best position in search results is having the best content. And if I have an article about Bartlett pears growing in San Diego and someone Googles it, and I&#8217;m the only article about that on the web, they&#8217;re gonna go right to me. No matter how performant my site is. Where performance comes in is as a waiting factor, like many, many other factors as a signal to Google. Just like HTTPS, mobile support. These are all signals that Google has announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, uh, you&#8217;re not gonna be like, penalized for poor performance. It&#8217;s more that if all other things are equal, this could be a weighting factor that would bump you up, having a better experience for your users. But that really shouldn&#8217;t be your motivation. Your motivation should be creating a better experience for your users first, and then secondly better achieving your goals once people reach your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone described it as a funnel, right? People think of web conversions as a funnel. You start at the top, all the people who see your search results, and then it gets smaller. All the people who click on your search results. And then, all the people who actually do something on your website. And then finally, this tiny, small number of people that convert to being paying customers. And I, and in my hands here just for audio, I&#8217;m going from wide to smaller. And where the user experience parts helps, uh, improving user pitch is not up here at the top in getting more search results. It&#8217;s here where once users reach your site, then you&#8217;re gonna really see that benefit. And so, that&#8217;s where you should think about where the benefit comes. It comes from turning those visiting users into actual, whatever your goal is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, I&#8217;m gonna go slightly off piste. Google does a fantastic job. I use Google photos, and Google Photos is able to identify the objects in my photos. And so I did wonder if there was a potential Google search. So, for example if I have a website I don&#8217;t label, I don&#8217;t put any metadata on my images at all. Does Google do any of that? This website is full of trees, and so if I search for a particular tree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:05] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> That&#8217;s a really good question. I don&#8217;t know the answer. I would say, first of all, please put alt tags on your images. Don&#8217;t do that. Because there&#8217;s a reason we have alt tags. Actually someone, so it&#8217;s the reason, the big reason is of course, accessibility, right. People who are visually impaired can&#8217;t see your images. It&#8217;s nice if they have a description of what they&#8217;re missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone actually today came by and said, do you think there&#8217;s a way we could take image recognition and make it so that non sighted users touch over the image, they get a description of what they&#8217;re seeing. So, if you&#8217;re a non sight user, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen people, a lot of times they actually use a touchscreen that&#8217;s haptic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:38] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> So they can move over and they can feel the buttons, right. It&#8217;s not just, having the buttons described to them in text, but literally a screen that as you&#8217;re moving over elements of the page, it bumps up. So you can actually feel, oh, there&#8217;s a button. That&#8217;s where the home button is, and then they can tap it, right? So they already have this technology, screens that are like this, and of course visually impair people are, are often used to reading braille, so they&#8217;re very sensitive with their fingers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So imagine something where you have a picture of trees and a person and a visually impaired person could move their hand over and say like, oh, there&#8217;s the person and there&#8217;s trees back here, and they&#8217;re feeling the image. Like that would be amazing. And that would again, require that same visual recognition of images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is a truly, astonishingly good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:14] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right, I had never heard that idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is just mind blowingly clever. Let&#8217;s hope that somebody can build that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah. There was another, just one more that someone posted recently to Twitter, you might have seen, but it&#8217;s the, it&#8217;s like the DALL E tools that are out now with the image generation. So someone has built a WordPress plugin in Gutenberg where you type in, like you&#8217;re working on your post and it&#8217;s about Bartlett pears in San Diego. So you type in like Bartletts flying across the San Diego Bay, and it generates an image for you of that. You&#8217;re there in Gutenberg and you just insert it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The whole AI piece. Rewind the clock just two years, and I thought it was, no, this is going nowhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:51] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> At no point in the future will you be able to tell a computer to create an image or a piece of art, or replicate, well, almost anything, but especially the things which don&#8217;t exist. You know, the triangle dog or whatever it might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:04] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, and yet you input it in and just in the space of two years, it&#8217;s gone me laughing at it. To me, just being in awe of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:13] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s truly amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:15] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Yeah, so I use one of those tools to generate all the images in my slideshow for my presentation yesterday. So I have like hilarious images, like a raccoon surf boarding and a, a goat driving a race car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:26] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Impossible things, but they look, you know, if you look closely, you can see some weird details. They&#8217;re very, very accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s lots of them as well. I believe the one that captured my attention recently, I think it was called Mind Journey or something like. It&#8217;s implementation is to create art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:43] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you give it the, the thing that you feed it is, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;d like a picture of a sunset that resembles Rembrandt, with a red sky to the left and so on. And it completely does it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:54] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> That&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, an absolute miracle. Adam Silverstein, thank you so much for joining me on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:00] <strong>Adam Silverstein:</strong> It was fun. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/adamsilverstein/\">Adam Silverstein</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam is a WordPress core comitter where he works to fix bugs and improve modern web capabilities. As a Developer Relations Engineer in the content ecosystem team at Google, he works to invigorate the open web by empowering and educating developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the recent WordCamp US, he gave a presentation entitled ‘Images on the Web &#8211; past present and future’. In it, he outlined his thoughts on where the web is going in terms of support for different image formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside text, images are the bedrock of webpages. We browse the internet and expect pages to have images of all forms. Photos, illustrations, charts and images to convey additional meaning to the text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do the images actually get on the page? WordPress makes handling images pretty easy, and Adam explains what happens when you upload an image to the Media Library, and then display it on a page or post in a browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the fact that different image sizes are created automatically by WordPress, which can be used in a variety of contexts across your website. You’ve likely heard of many of them, but perhaps you have not thought about which format belongs where.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with code, the technology behind images does not stand still. New formats are being created all the time and are being supported at differing rates by the major browser vendors. In the past we typically used JPEG, GIF or PNG files to display images on our websites, but there’s good reason to think about adopting other defaults in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss some of these new formats, such as WebP, AVIF and JPEG XL, and find out about how they are speeding up website loading times because of their smaller file sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into how you can optimise your images, and how plugins and SaaS solutions can reduce the size of your files before or after you upload them to your WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam has some good advice about a topic which is becoming increasingly important, page load time, and if you’ve never given this serious thought, this is a great podcast episode for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, when we record the podcast, there’s not a lot of background noise, but that’s not always the case. Over the coming weeks, I’ll be bringing you recordings from a recent trip to WordCamp US 2022, and you might notice that the recordings have a little echo or other strange audio artefacts. Whilst the podcasts are more than listenable, I hope you understand that the vagaries of the real world were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/34-felix-arntz-on-wordpress-and-performance\">Jukebox Podcast episode 34 – Felix Arntz on WordPress and Performance</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\">Can I Use website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://libgd.github.io/\">LibGD graphics library</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-diffusion-plugin-creates-ai-generated-images-from-text-prompts\">New Block Diffusion Plugin Creates AI-Generated Images from Text Prompts</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/home/\">Midjourney</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"HeroPress: Making The World A Better Place One Line Of Code At A Time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=4906\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:190:\"https://heropress.com/essays/making-the-world-a-better-place-one-line-of-code-at-a-time/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-the-world-a-better-place-one-line-of-code-at-a-time\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16606:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/101922-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Making The World A Better Place One Line Of Code At A Time.

At that time I was working as a designer for a company dedicated to sports and we were working internally on a kind of CMS to digitize our Football News magazine, but the result was horrendous, the interface did not exist, it constantly crashed and it was full of bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how in the year 2008-2009 in an Internet search I discovered WP, its version at that time 2.5, I couldn&#8217;t get us to use WP as a CMS and the internal solution won. But there was one seed planted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time I used WordPress in a very simple way, my background was a graphic designer, I didn&#8217;t know anything about PHP, much less about programming, but studying the WP code I was able to make my first themes, which by the way were terrible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned HTML and CSS, at the same time I started taking Programming courses, especially in PHP, and that&#8217;s how I started this adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first years were literally learning on my own, in my bubble, then I started to add the word web developer in my resume, I found a job in a company as a designer and web master, I designed gif banners, magazine ads, brochures and the website , this company had its page in ASP and since it was very complicated to update it, at least for me, I gave myself the task of migrating it to WordPress, it was 2014 and WP was in version 3.9, this was my first job in which I did everything from the design to the development and programming of the theme, in it I put into practice everything I had learned until then.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_d7c6c7-b7 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I met Roberto Remedios, my tattoo artist who was also his tattoo artist, told him that if didn&#8217;t know me?, Costa Rica is a small country where one way or another we all have friends in common, he told him that my passion was WordPress, when we met we didn&#8217;t stop talking about how cool it was, but what caught my attention the most was the word Community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community </strong>what was that?, I had spent so many years working on my own that I didn&#8217;t know that it even existed, my concept of Open Source was simply something free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roberto convinced me that same year to go to WordCamp Miami, it was my first camp, meeting the community behind WP was something that impressed me a lot, the talks, the desire to teach and learn from all the participants, and above all to collaborate with the community, wow everything changed for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we got back, Roberto and I started talking about the possibility of holding a WordCamp in San José, Costa Rica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of that process is giving talks before the camp as a way to promote it, and as a member of the newly founded WordPress Costa Rica group, it was time for me to give a talk. It was the first time I spoke in front of the public since my student days, I remember how nervous I was, my talk revolved around page builders, there was no Gutenberg back then, I managed to get the Meetup sponsored, there were snacks, swags, A lot of people came, it was incredible. Colleagues who participated that day in that Meetup, are still an active part of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I gave that same talk at WordCamp and it was even more stressful, because my computer did not turn on, at that moment they lent me a computer, but oh surprise I could not run my test site, after 20min I was able to solve the problem, the JavaScript was disabled. I was already sweating profusely, red with shame, in the end I was able to give the talk and everything ended well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp San Jose, it was incredible, it was hard work, very rewarding, it was a success, never before had I felt so good professionally, years had passed, without sharing something that I like so much with anyone, suddenly we had a community, we meet regularly, and share about what we are most passionate about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently my talks revolve around making my local community aware of new WordPress trends, I collaborate as an administrator of the WordPress Costa Rica group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_fdbe32-4a wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Outside Costa Rica</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second year that I attended WordCamp Miami, I participated as a volunteer, and I had the opportunity to interact with many of the humans that I follow on social media, and then I was encouraged to send talks and participate in the WordCamps that take place in my region. Eager to share what I have learned, to date I have participated as a volunteer, speaker, and organizer in my city Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico and in the first Central American WordCamp which was held online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the talks in another language, I have had the opportunity to give talks in Rome, Italy, I participated as a volunteer in the WordCamp US, where I had the opportunity to meet colleagues and the CEO of a company that I admire a lot, this was in Nashville , U.S. seeing colleagues with whom I have had the privilege of working today, my circle of friends expanded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also had participate in online conferences, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B33I2bvt6TQ\">GatsbyConf</a>, <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/talks/gatsby-wordpress-alfredo-navas-fernandini/\">JavaScript For WordPress</a> and at <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/session/headless-wordpress- gatsby-or-nextjs/\">WordCamp EU 2021</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to share and talk about JAMStack, especially with GatsbyJS and WordPress as a headless CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_aa6505-fd wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Professional Path</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a lot to thank WordPress for, the first thing it brought was the curiosity to learn programming, then remote work. I started working for an agency located in Austin, Texas, with several collaborators in Costa Rica, it was the year 2017, they hired me for my knowledge in WordPress, it was not only the first time that I could work completely dedicated to WP, but also from my house, I never set foot in an office again, seeing my children grow up and above all working in flip flops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same year, together with my wife, we founded a small specialized WordPress agency, which we still have and is managed by her. Our most recent work was the website for <a href=\"https://premiosacam.com/\">Costa Rican Music Awards</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_e72b3f-d5 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Expanding my Career</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to pay attention to the Job Boards that you find when you go to a WordCamp, I was looking for the opportunity to work on larger projects, corporate projects where Icould expand my knowledge, I started applying, I was convinced that I had the level to work in a dedicated agency 100 % to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worked for agencies in New York and DC but I was still searching for a place to really fit, and the opportunity came, with perseverance and effort today I work as a Senior Frontend Engineer, in the agency that I most admire, WebDevStudios, dedicated 100% to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress definitely changed my life personally and professionally, I have met incredible people and places, above all I have been able to give time and a quality life to my family, I have learned a lot, and still learning, I write about WordPress, I help my community teaching about the tools with which they can carry out their ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I am doing what I love the most, making the world a better place one line of code at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"espanol\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_68c620-ba wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Hacer Del Mundo Un Lugar Mejor Una Linea De Codigo A La Vez</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_c92a36-80 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Como Conoci WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Parece que fue ayer cuando me dije a mi mismo&#8230; <strong>¿T</strong>iene que haber una mejor manera de hacer esto? En ese entonces me desempeñaba como diseñador para una empresa dedicada a los deportes y estábamos trabajando internamente en una especie de CMS para digitalizar nuestra revista Football News, pero el resultado era horrendo, la interface inexistente, se caía constantemente y estaba lleno de bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fue así como en el año 2008-2009 en una busqueda en la Internet descubrí WP, su versión en ese entonces 2.5, no logre que usaramos WP como CMS y la solución interna gano. Pero habia quedado una semillla,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ese entonces usaba WordPress de una manera muy simple, mi background era disenador grafico, no sabía nada de PHP, mucho menos de programación, pero estudiando el código de WP pude hacer mis primeros temas, que por por cierto eran terribles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aprendi HTML, y CSS, al tiempo empece a llevar cursos de Programacion, sobre todo en PHP y así inicio esta aventura.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Los primero años fueron literalmente aprendiendo por mi cuenta, en mi burbuja, luego empeze a agregar la palabra desarrollador web en mi curriculum, encontre trabajo en una empresa como diseñador y web master, diseñaba gif banners, anucios para revista, brochures y la pagina web, esta empresa tenia su pagina en ASP y como era muy complicado actualizarla, al menos para mi, me di la tarea de migrarla a WordPress, era el 2014 y WP estaba en us version 3.9, este fue mi primer trabajo en cual hice todo desde el diseño hasta el desarrollo y programacion del tema, en el puse en practica todo lo que habia aprendido hasta ese entonces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_6b09c6-ce wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Comunidad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Y la vida siguio su rumbo y en el año 2016, conoci a Roberto Remedios, Mi tatuador que era a la vez su tatuador, le decia que <strong>¿S</strong>i no me conocia?, Costa Rica es un pais pequeño donde de alguna u otra forma todos tenemos amigos en comun, el le comentaba que mi pasion era WordPress, cuando nos conocimos no paramos de</p>\n\n\n\n<p>hablar sobre lo cool que era, pero lo que mas me llamo la atencion era la palabra Comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>¿</strong>Comunidad que era eso?, habia pasado tantos años trabajando por mi cuenta que no sabia que eso si quiera existia, mi concepto de Open Source era simplemente algo gratis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roberto me convencio ese mismo año de ir WordCamp Miami, fue mi primer camp, conocer la comunidad que había detrás de WP fue algo que me impresionó mucho, las charlas, las ganas de enseñar y de aprender de todos los participantes, y sobre todo colaborar con la comunidad, wow todo cambio para mi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuando regresamos Roberto y yo empezamos a conversar sobre la posibilidad de hacer un WordCamp en San José, Costa Rica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parte de ese proceso es dar charlas antes del camp como una forma de promoverlo, y como miembro del recién fundado grupo de WordPress Costa Rica, me llego el momento de dar una charla. Era la primera vez que hablaba frente al publico desde mis tiempos de estudiante, recuerdo lo nervioso que estaba, mi charla giraba en torno a los page builders, no había gutenberg en ese entonces, logre que el Meetup fuera patrocinado, habian snacks, swags, llego bastante gente, fue increible.

Maintaining current documentation has not been a strong point of the official Gutenberg project as the pace of the project makes it difficult for contributors and extenders to keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg introduced an entirely new editorial paradigm for content creation and page building within WordPress,&#8221; 10up Associate Director of Editorial Engineering Fabian Kaegy said. &#8220;Because the block editor is still fairly new, it is advancing quickly and changes are introduced regularly; as such, learning opportunities are scarce and we have felt an absence of best practice documentation that meets 10up standards for craftsmanship.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10up&#8217;s Gutenberg Best Practices were written to supplement WordPress&#8217; core documentation with what Kaegy said is a &#8220;more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers who are brand new to working with the block editor, the <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/reference/\">Reference</a> section has a wealth of information about the anatomy of a block, the fundamentals of block theming with theme.json, block extensions, block variations, and more, with supporting videos and gifs. The documentation also gives a little more context for practical usage. For example, the section about <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/reference/Blocks/block-transforms\">Block Transforms</a> includes information about when and how to define block transforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Training section of 10up&#8217;s Gutenberg Best Practices contains a mini crash course on the file structure of a block and all of its components, and how to build a custom block using the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/wp-scaffold/tree/trunk/themes/10up-theme/includes/blocks/example-block\">10up Starter Block</a>. This is especially helpful for developers looking for some extra guidance developing their first blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/guides/\">Guides</a> section contains more advanced topics like extending core blocks and including frontend JS with a block. The documentation is <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices\">available on GitHub</a> for anyone to contribute edits. The site also links to a <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices/discussions\">discussion board on GitHub</a> where developers are welcome to join discussions and workshop the best practices in collaboration with 10up employees. 10up has published the Gutenberg Best Practices website with a beta designation and intends to update and expand it as WordPress evolves.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 21:46:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 2 (RC2) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13646\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6966:\"<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The second release candidate (RC2) for WordPress 6.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>“Release Candidate” means that this version of WordPress is ready for release and it is a key milestone in the 6.1 release cycle! Before the official release date, the community sets aside time to perform final reviews and help test. Since the WordPress ecosystem includes thousands of plugins and themes, it is important that everyone checks to see if anything has been missed along the way. That means the project would <em>greatly benefit from</em> your assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is planned for official release on November 1st, 2022, two weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>.

Jetpack is shuffling its monetization strategy for this extension and has capped social sharing at 30 shares per month for the free tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/social/\">new paid plan</a> offers 1,000 shares and re-shares per month, starting at $1/month for the first month and is $10/month thereafter.

Publishers that are used to being able to automatically share all their posts for free should be aware this change that limits them to to 30 shares per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would not be surprised to see some users switch to another social sharing plugin, as many others offer far more social networks and don&#8217;t limit the number of times users can share. Instead they opt to restrict re-sharing, scheduling, or the ability to connect multiple accounts per social network. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Social has a new team behind it focused on making the product better. In 2021, Automattic <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-social-image-generator-plugin-plans-to-integrate-with-jetpack\">acquired the Social Image Generator plugin</a> with plans to integrate it into Jetpack&#8217;s social media tools. This may make the product more compelling, since it currently doesn&#8217;t stand up well to the myriad of free sharing plugins out there. Jetpack only supports four social networks, but the team is working on expanding the plugin&#8217;s capabilities. The plugin&#8217;s development team also <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%5BType%5D+Feature&template=feature-request.yml&title=Feature+Request%3A\">accepts feature suggestions</a> on its GitHub repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.4.0 of the Jetpack Social plugin moved the share limits code to the Publicize package and added a meter to show users how many shares they have remaining. Users on the free plan should notice these changes in their dashboards.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 14:54:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Do The Woo Community: A WooSesh Chat with Paul Maiorana, Kimberly Coleman and Courtney Robertson\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73148\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"https://dothewoo.io/woosesh-chat-paul-maiorana-kimberly-coleman-courtney-robertson/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:454:\"<p>In this show we talk about the new turnkey WooCommerce, flash sales year round and a look at the first day of sessions. </p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woosesh-chat-paul-maiorana-kimberly-coleman-courtney-robertson/\">A WooSesh Chat with Paul Maiorana, Kimberly Coleman and Courtney Robertson</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 10:15:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: Plugin Dependencies Feature Plugin Now Ready for Testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138684\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/plugin-dependencies-feature-plugin-now-ready-for-testing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3427:\"<p>For more than a decade, WordPress developers have been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/yet-another-plugin-dependencies-discussion-two-proposals-this-time\">discussing</a> how core can support plugins that require one or more other plugins in order to work. Having a standardized way of managing plugin dependencies would be a useful and time-saving feature for developers, who currently have to roll their own solutions for this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The situation there is a lot like the relationship between parent and child themes,&#8221; project lead Andy Fragen said in February when <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/24/feature-project-plugin-dependencies/\">introducing the idea for the feature plugin</a>. &#8220;Without their relationships to the bigger plugin, those dependent plugins can do very little. Every plugin developer is on their own to code a solution to resolve the issue. The single most common example is WooCommerce, which is a dependency for hundreds, if not thousands, of WooCommerce add-on plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After nine months of discussion and development, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-plugin-dependencies/\">Plugin Dependencies feature plugin</a> is now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/call-for-testing-plugin-dependencies/\">ready for testing</a>. It allows plugin authors to specify any WordPress.org-hosted plugin(s) that are required for their plugins to function. A plugin that has dependencies can be identified by adding a “Requires Plugins” header to the docblock of the main plugin file. Plugin authors can specify as many dependencies as necessary in a comma-separated list of plugin slugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it work? Site owners will get an admin notice if there are dependencies they need to install. The plugin card will be updated to display the <em>Requires</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Required by</em>&nbsp;information on the Plugins screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Fragen <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/call-for-testing-plugin-dependencies/\">outlined</a> how the community can test the new core support for handling plugin dependencies. You do not have to be a developer to participate in testing this new feature. It involves installing test plugin files and confirming admin notices appear and disappear at the right times. Testers who are comfortable editing plugin files can try adding dependencies, adding a dependency for non-WordPress.org plugins, and other more advanced tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version control is not part of this project, so developers will not be able to specify a minimum required version, for example. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Version control&nbsp;is out of scope for the feature as described in the original Make post referenced above,&#8221; Fragen said in response to a question on the feature plugin. &#8220;As the majority of the dependencies come from the dot org repository, the most current versions will be installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Specifically, WordPress should automatically prompt the user to update to the current version and may use auto-updates as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing will be open until December 1, 2022. Anyone who wants to be part of moving this long-awaited feature towards a possible inclusion in core can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wp-plugin-dependencies/issues/new\">report issues</a> to the WP Plugin Dependencies plugin&#8217;s repository.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 02:53:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.0.3 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13618\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-0-3-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6149:\"<p><strong>WordPress 6.0.3</strong> is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release features several security fixes.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today I have with me Nick Diego. Welcome, Nick, to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell me a bit about yourself, just kind of your history with WordPress and then what it is that you&#8217;ve been doing with the WordPress 6.1 release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I&#8217;m actually kind of new to working with WordPress full-time. Up until about June of last year, I was in the hospitality industry for a career of 10 years. But I always loved doing WordPress on the side. And after the long pandemic, I figured it was time to kind of pursue my passion and work with WordPress full-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that ultimately led to my current role as a developer advocate at WPEngine, where I focus primarily on WordPress and contribution to Core itself. And then I guess it was maybe March or April this year when <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>, who I&#8217;ve worked with a ton, she asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in helping out on 6.0 as an Editor Triage Lead which was an awesome experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I&#8217;m back for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. I always like to hear about people who are coming to do repeat tours of duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:01:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t refer to working on WordPress releases as a tour of duty. However, I find that releases are so large and complex, and there are so many people in there now that working on them takes an entirely different skill set now than it used to take when WordPress was like 1% of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think it&#8217;s a really big task, and I think it&#8217;s great when people were, like, that was either so good that I would do it again, or I would like a second go because I could do it better. Whichever way brings people to it. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:18]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I was just gonna say that&#8217;s a great point because the Editor Triage Lead, which is the role that I currently have, was a brand new role for 6.0. The project kind of got so big that it kind of made sense to have a triage lead focused specifically on Gutenberg. Gutenberg&#8217;s such a big part of WordPress now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s where that role kind of came from, and now we&#8217;ve carried it over to 6.1. As the project grows, we need more people to come in and help make sure the release is as smooth as it can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Because of that promise of backward compatibility and all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:48]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So, by the time this releases, if I recall correctly, we will have passed RC2, or RC2 is coming the next day or something like that. We&#8217;re right around the Release Candidate two. So you have been doing this for quite some time on this particular release. So far, what is the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about that&#8217;s going out in the 6.1 release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is going to sound really boring, but it&#8217;s actually incredibly exciting. So, the most exciting quote-unquote feature that I&#8217;m excited about is the improved consistency and standardization of block controls that are coming in 6.1. So things like typography and color and borders and dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are things and tools that we&#8217;ve had in a lot of core blocks, but it hasn&#8217;t been consistent throughout. And a ton of work has been done in 6.1 to establish that consistency. We&#8217;re not a hundred percent there, but typography, I think we&#8217;re at like 85% of all core blocks now support all the typography controls, and with each release as we head to 6.2, we&#8217;ll improve on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really great for theme builders, theme designers, and users to be able to control the look and feel blocks consistently throughout the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna immediately answer you earlier with like, there are no boring answers, there are no boring improvements. And as you were explaining why it is that you kind of thought it might be considered boring, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that anytime that you&#8217;re increasing the consistency and you&#8217;re increasing the confidence between what you saw on the back end and what you actually shipped on the front end– anytime you&#8217;re doing that, I think that that is exciting in the prove the negative way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about the negative excitement that occurs when you have published something, and it looks one way in the back end, and then it looks totally different on the front end, and the panic you feel when you have to fix. Not having that is a really big step up, I think. And so anything that provides more consistency for people who are using WordPress, people who are building with WordPress, I always find exciting. But also, like, I&#8217;m an office person, and so I would find office things exciting, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:04:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a more delightful experience. I do a lot of work on the Training team, doing educational things, and we teach people how to change typography and change color. Once they learn how to do it in one block, if they can take that same skill set and apply it to any other block, it&#8217;s that light bulb moment. They understand they know how to manipulate and use WordPress to its fullest. So adding that consistency really helps to level up users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna take us off track a little bit and just ask a general question here. Like, I remember the first time that I was working with what was a site, I guess, qualified for a site at the time. And I remember the first time that I discovered that I could change the look and feel with HTML and CSS, and I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also was like, well, I accept my fate. Whatever happens, if I kill everything I&#8217;ve ever written, that is just how it&#8217;ll be. Like the sheer terror of all of that is so different now. Do you recall that first moment where you&#8217;re like, Oh, I do have some power over this? I have some control over this, and whether you also found it scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:05:52]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came to WordPress kinda as a hobby and website development kind of as a hobby. So I was kind of always in that tinkering phase, or I wasn&#8217;t building something for anyone else. I was in a safe place to destroy whatever I was working on with my tinkering. So I never really quite had that fear, but I can definitely see it from the perspective of building something for somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the editor and the controls that we have, and you know, now make it a lot easier to kind of manipulate and exert your creative desires in WordPress than it was before with CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the phrase ‘I was safe to destroy things, ’ and if I can figure out a way to make it a tagline for something, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:31]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. So during your second time around here on the release squad with 6.1, what have been the bright spots of that experience, and have there been any unexpected challenges of being on the release squad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I come to WordPress from, you know, from a different career. It&#8217;s kind of a passion of mine to be working with WordPress. So I kinda have a unique experience than maybe some others. And when I approach WordPress, there&#8217;s always that tendency to say, ‘why doesn&#8217;t it do this?’ Or ‘why don&#8217;t they do this?’ And I&#8217;ve always been the person…, well, it&#8217;s open source. We, we, we can, we can</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…can do it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…we can do it. And so that&#8217;s kind of how I approach things. Now, of course, you know, I have the privilege of time to do that. Not everybody does, but one of the unexpected bright spots about working in a release squad is understanding how it all works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does WordPress actually get built? What is the process that it goes through? It was just eye-opening to me, and I really got a shout-out, Anne, for inviting me to be on 6.0. It brought me in. I learned so much about it, and now I&#8217;m just excited to keep working on these releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a release is hard. You know, it&#8217;s a… WordPress is huge. There are a lot of moving parts, there are a lot of things going on. Right now, we&#8217;re trying to get everything ready for the first release candidate. So being on the release squad is not an easy job. But it&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s fun, and you really feel like you&#8217;re part of that ‘we’ really helping to build WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I hope that people have learned from any time that they spent working with me is that like we understand here in the WordPress open source project, and I believe that all open source projects must understand this, but like every change that you make, if there are things that are dependent on it, which is gonna be true for most of us, we&#8217;ll have intended consequences and also unexpected consequences, and unintended, unexpected consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve always felt like the thing that really makes the biggest difference about how we do open source in WordPress is that, for the most part, we have a concept of where the most likely changes are going to happen across our entire ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a better understanding, at least compared to when I got here, a better understanding of how interconnected it all is. And so you&#8217;ve got this change here, and it looks small, but it&#8217;s gonna have this positive or negative impact as you kind of work your way out from it. And so I think that that is an interesting thing, and certainly, you get a really clear concept of it in the release squad, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, absolutely. If you were to build something like the block editor without caring at all about backward compatibility, you&#8217;d be done by now, right? I mean, so much of what we do is concerning ourselves with making sure that everybody who&#8217;s on a classic theme or hybrid theme or whatever it might be that they continue to use WordPress in a safe and stable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of being such a large content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you already told us the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about, and so now I&#8217;m gonna ask you about what feature or what bug fix has the most notable improvements that are coming to 6.1. This is a little different as in, like, there&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;re excited about, which is an office thing, but like a thing that is maybe not new but has the biggest delta, the biggest change to anyone&#8217;s experience of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so obviously, in 5.9, we introduced full site editing, and 6.0 was a natural progression from that with more and more features. Now it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;s only a small fraction of websites that are using the whole full site editing of or block themes, all that kind of stuff. One of the hangups about that was managing templates inside of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could add the files to your theme, which would then show up in the site editor. But there wasn&#8217;t a direct way to add more complicated templates within the site editor itself. That is changing in 6.1. So now you actually have the functionality to install something like 2023, which is the new core theme, and build out all these very complicated templates within the UI of the site editor that you could not have done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:10:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that the biggest benefit of full site editing is really to empower no-code or low-code users. And the ability to add these templates directly in the UI really levels them up. Because now, you can do all that complicated stuff that you normally would need to be adding to theme files and jumping into the code. You can do that within the site editor now, which I think is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. And just a general caveat, anytime that we talk about anything that&#8217;s very developer-y or very no code-y, I think it&#8217;s always worth mentioning, yes, a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do with the block editor is to just kind of give some power back to folks who cannot find the time to become a developer or don&#8217;t have the inclination. They don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that does not mean that no code is ever involved in WordPress. It&#8217;s still a software. You can still do very complicated things with it. And if you are a developer, you should not think to yourself, ‘oh now that it&#8217;s being available to low code/no code users, that means you don&#8217;t want me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s not at all what&#8217;s happening. You can do very complicated things still.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:11:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so that brings us to our final question here because we like to stay as true to the name as possible here on the WP Briefing. If someone were wanting to get involved with the next release, so WP 6.2, how would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:12:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, talk to Anne, and she&#8217;ll get you set up. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. So at the, after each release, there&#8217;s a posting that goes out that lists all the different release teams, and you can just put your name out there and ask to be, you know, for consideration to be part of the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will say that the best thing you can do right now is help with 6.1. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a release lead to do that testing, helping with bug fixes. Reach out to me. Reach out to other release leads, and we&#8217;ll get you involved and engaged with the release. That will give you a really good framework to start working and become a release lead for 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think we talked maybe two or three episodes ago, or it could be more than that, I&#8217;ll never know, about the release squad, like the group that&#8217;s doing that. In the event you think to yourself, ‘there&#8217;s no way in a million years that I&#8217;m gonna just show up tomorrow and be part of the release squad,’ I heard what they said in the first question/answer moment– that&#8217;s fine, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nick mentioned, you can always get involved with testing, you can get involved with triage. Those are areas where any feedback at all is valuable because we can get better information about what worked and didn&#8217;t, what was expected versus what happened. And that type of information is where all of our co-creators of the WordPress software–really, we rely on what you all are pointing out to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not shining spotlights on the most painful parts of your experience, sometimes we don&#8217;t necessarily know that that&#8217;s a pain point for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:34]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, that&#8217;s a great place to start. If you are more of a writer, technical or prose, there are different spaces you can go to, like keep our docs up to date or make sure that people know that changes are coming at all in WordPress because that&#8217;s a thing. If you are a backend developer, we have a million things you can do because that&#8217;s just all day, every day, for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just all the deep backend work. And so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:13:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to mention that, you know, being on the release team does not necessarily mean that you&#8217;re incredibly technical. We have a documentation lead, we have a design lead, you know, a communication lead. So there&#8217;s a lot of different roles in the team that, you know, across all disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don&#8217;t think if you&#8217;re not a hardcore developer, that precludes you from being on the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you&#8217;re really good with common sense and working fully remotely, you can be the release coordinator. I can tell you because I did that for 5.0. It was a big job. It was our, it was the first time we had a release squad as opposed to just like the release lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there was just so much that was going into that and so much riding on it. And like you said in some other answer that you gave like if you were to just be like, we&#8217;re shutting everything down and rewriting this in six months, and I hope you can come with us on it. Like a lot of open source projects do it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:51]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is a choice, and we made the opposite choice. And so we&#8217;re bringing all of our co-conspirators with us, all of our co-creators of WordPress. That&#8217;s the hope all the time. Making sure that they have enough information, that they feel safe to destroy things, enough information, and skills about how to get out of it, that they always feel some high confidence in what they&#8217;re trying to do versus what they actually did do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, excellent. Nick, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:15:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. I just hope everybody goes out and downloads 6.1 and enjoys it as much as I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, go check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And actually, it is a pretty big list today, but still pretty big things too. So first up, we have a call for testing that is out, and it is for our Android users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a call for testing for WordPress for Android 20.9, and I feel like we don&#8217;t get a lot of calls for testing for Android devices. And so if you have been feeling left out or just like we don&#8217;t always have that kind of mobile testing available, this is the opportunity for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that tomorrow, we have RC2, release candidate two for WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s coming out on October 18th. There will be a link in the show notes, but that means if you write a plugin or a theme or have anything that kind of extends the core of WordPress, now is the time to start testing anything that might be a bug or represent a breaking change and make sure that you file those bugs so that we can get things as settled and excellent as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of Word points, uh, WordPress 6.1, not Word point, WordPress 6.1. I actually have three changes that I think are going to represent some pretty big changes for folks. I will have links to all of these in the show notes. If you don&#8217;t know where the show notes are, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the three things that I think are gonna be big, worthwhile things. The first one is multisite improvements, and the second one will be the style engine that&#8217;s block styles generation tool, which will ship in Core and I think is really important for y&#8217;all to take a look at. And then also there are some changes coming to the block editor preferences.<br /><br />Like I said, links to all of those are going to be in the show notes, and so they should be pretty easy for you to find.

Many content creators have waited for this for years: Now the block editor will actually remember your setting to switch on the Top Toolbar, and switch off the Full-screen view, and switch off the Welcome screen. Now it&#8217;s all stored in the database of your sites. It does not save it across multiple sites, though. WordPress is powerful but not that powerful. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Developer are now empowered <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\"><strong>extending the Query Loop block</strong></a>. This post <strong>Nik Tsekouras</strong>, explains how you can add your custom query arguments via a block variation of the Query Loop block. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor now also has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\"><strong>Filters for theme.json data</strong></a>, with it plugin and theme developer can query the styling and layout data for all three levels: Blocks, Themes and User. <strong>André Maneiro</strong> has the details for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Components are the building blocks of core blocks and can also be used for custom blocks.  <strong>Marco Ciampini</strong> explained the <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/editor-components-updates-for-wordpress-6-1/\">Editor Components updates in WordPress 6.1</a>. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, styling via theme.json only worked for blocks and for Global styling. Now theme developers can start <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/styling-elements-in-block-themes/\"><strong>styling elements in block themes</strong></a>,  that means all headers, regardless of where they are added can be consistently styled, same for buttons or input fields. This reduces considerably the lines in a theme&#8217;s custom style.css. This Dev note was authored by <strong>Ben Dwyer</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ramon Dodd</strong> explained in his post the details of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/block-styles-generation-style-engine/\"><strong>Block styles generation (Style Engine)</strong></a>, how the styles found in themes, blocks, Styles UI and core blocks all come together in a black box before they reach the frontend of the site. Or something to that effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adam Zielinski </strong>and <strong>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</strong> summarized the  <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/block-api-changes-in-wordpress-6-1/\">Block API changes in WordPress 6.1</a>.</strong> They explain several new&nbsp;Block&nbsp;API&nbsp;features available via the&nbsp;<code>block.json</code>&nbsp;file, specifically the new <code>render</code> attribute for dynamic block PHP templates, how multiple scripts can now registered for blocks, and developers can import single core blocks into their apps, rather than all core/blocks/ </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the missing pieces for curating the editing experience were <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/content-locking-features-and-updates/\">Content locking features and updates</a>.</strong> In his dev note, <strong>Jorge Costa</strong> explains how content-only editing for blocks, patterns, and templates, will work and how a template lock inheritance for the Column&nbsp;block functions. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/simplified-data-access-with-new-react-hooks-in-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Simplified data access with new React hooks in WordPress 6.1</strong></a>&nbsp;ensure a better WordPress developer experience, we learn from <strong>Adam Zielinski&#8217;</strong>s dev note.  The amount of code necessary to access WordPress data like post, pages, users, or custom post types have been considerably reduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his post <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/reference-styles-values-in-theme-json/\"><strong>Reference Styles values in theme.json</strong></a>, <strong>Ben Dwyer</strong> outlines how you can ensure consistency and avoid duplication of code across entities. If you have a color palette defined, blocks and template parts can reference the particular variable across all other styles so they adhere to the color palette of the theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Alexander</strong> wrote about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/improved-php-performance-for-core-blocks-registration/\"><strong>Improved PHP performance for core blocks registration</strong></a> which is achieved through making sure that only the files required for the blocks on the canvas are loaded in memory. Until now, all 70+ core blocks were loaded all the time. That&#8217;s a huge performance gain for WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/enhanced-typescript-support-in-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Enhanced TypeScript support in WordPress 6.1</strong></a> improves the developer experience for WordPress developers, as most programming tools tap into the Typescript signatures and notify the developer, when there is the wrong type or required arguments are missing. In the video embedded into the post,  <strong>Adam Zielinski</strong> shows the interaction of an&nbsp;IDE&nbsp;for auto-completion and static checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ramon Dodd</strong> also write about the implementation of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/03/fluid-font-sizes-in-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Fluid font sizes in WordPress 6.1</strong></a>. You learn how they work and how you can control them via the theme.json file. This is another feature improving the overall responsiveness of the block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In the post, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/miscellaneous-editor-changes-for-wordpress-6-1/\"><strong>Miscellaneous editor changes for WordPress 6.1</strong></a>, you learn about the small changes and sometime also make a big difference, for instance, content patterns for custom post types, improvements to the Cover block, or a new filter for he Navigation block. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a consistent UI for blocks, was one of the focuses for this WordPress release. The team is about 50% there. In this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/11/roster-of-design-tools-per-block/\"><strong>Roster of design tools per block</strong></a>, you can look up which blocks have which set of design tools in the categories: Typography, Color, Dimension, Border, and Layout controls. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-gutenberg-14-3-released\">Gutenberg 14.3 released</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Robertshaw</strong>  was the release lead for version 14.3 of the Gutenberg plugin.

It&#8217;s still experimental and requires the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/[https://twitter.com/mrpaultruong\">Paul Truong</a> </strong> published his first theme ever, called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/molten/\"><strong>Molten</strong></a>, a theme for passionate chefs and restaurateurs. You can find 20 well-designed patterns listed and when you add the string <code>?beta=style_variations</code> to the theme&#8217;s URL you can also browse through an additional three Style Variations. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another first block theme contribution in the repository is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/raft/\">Raft by Themeisle</a>, with seven Style Variations, and nine patterns. <strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> has a review for you. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/raft-a-new-multipurpose-block-theme-for-wordpress\"><strong>Raft: A New Multipurpose Block Theme for WordPress</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Will Morris</strong> published his tutorial on <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2022/10/create-wordpress-block-theme/\"><strong>How to Create a WordPress Block Theme (In 3 Steps)</strong></a> on the Torque Magazine site. The steps he explains are: Install a WordPress block theme, customize your theme with the Site Editor, export your modifications as a new block theme. Morris works through all that using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/\">Create Block Theme plugin</a> by the WordPress team in the plugins repository. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Gardner</strong> shared in his post <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/box-shadow-style-blocks/\"><strong>Create a Box-shadow Style for Various Blocks</strong></a> the necessary code snippets to add box shadow to Images, Buttons, and Quote Blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Julio Marchi</strong> explored <a href=\"https://thedigitalinsider.com/why-classic-wordpress-themes-arent-going-away/\"><strong>Why Classic WordPress Themes Aren’t Going Away</strong></a> on the blog The Digital Insider. One of the reasons is that classic themes provide a higher flexibility to build advanced bespoke themes. Marchi also points out that new features comeing to WordPress include ways for classic themes to make use of the theme.json file as well as the feature to allow block-theme template parts to be added to classic themes and offer patterns for those templates parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>New on WordPress TV: <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2022/10/14/lets-code-creating-custom-templates-and-template-parts/\"><strong>Let’s code: creating custom templates and template parts</strong></a> with <strong>Jonathan Bossenger</strong>.

Kägy is an Associate Director of Editorial Engineering at 10up, an agency with plenty of contributions to the WordPress open-source project. They built highly visible websites, like The White House, Five Thirty Eight, or the World Economic Forum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kägy wrote in his post:  &#8220;Our Gutenberg Best Practices are meant to work in tandem with the WordPress Core documentation and expand upon its foundation to provide a more client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.&#8221; The microsite is divided up on Training, Reference, and Guides.  Check it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nathan Wrigley</strong> had <strong>Nick Diego</strong> as guest on the 46th episode of the WPTavern Jukebox podcast and discussed <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/46-nick-diego-on-why-you-should-be-excited-about-the-possibilities-of-wordpress-blocks\"><strong>Why You Should Be Excited About the Possibilities of WordPress Blocks</strong></a>. Wrigley wrote: &#8220;It’s becoming easier to create the blocks, as the tools take away much of the technical burden of getting you up and running without advanced knowledge of JavaScript and React. Coupled with core components, native block supports, and a bit of guidance, Nick thinks that every WordPress developer can add custom blocks to their repertoire.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brian Coords</strong> discovered the <a href=\"https://www.briancoords.com/wordpress-secret-world-of-javascript/\"><strong>WordPress’ Secret World of JavaScript</strong></a>, when taking the new Course on <em>Learn.WordPress</em> <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/using-the-wordpress-data-layer/\">Using the WordPress Data Layer</a>. Coords also marveled on the fact that all the great tools available to allow developers to build on basis of WordPress outside the block editor for instance on settings pages of a plugin or on supplement admin pages and not many are using them (yet). </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cameron Jones</strong> also shared his experience developing around the block editor and found: <a href=\"https://cameronjonesweb.com.au/blog/adding-a-custom-icon-to-the-social-links-block-should-not-be-this-hard/\"><strong>Adding A Custom Icon To The Social Links Block Should Not Be This Hard</strong></a>. His task was to add another service and icon to the core&#8217;s Social Block. Jones takes us along his journey of figuring out how to accomplish this task. There were a few U-turns and cul-de-sac moments on the way. I found it quite an interesting read, as it elaborated on the gaps that need to be closed for the Gutenberg project to be more attractive to extenders in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to believe Jones, it was not missing documentation. &#8220;And to my pleasant surprise, the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">official documentation</a> was quite good in this regard.&#8221; he wrote. And after going through all the up and downs of learning new things, Jones concluded: <em>&#8220;The provision of the <code>@wordpress/scripts</code> package and much improved documentation makes me feel far more confident in starting to approach development for the block editor again.&#8221;</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I have to agree with Jones: it shouldn&#8217;t be so hard to add another block variations to a block that mostly sports block variations out of the box. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his tutorial <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/rendering-external-api-data-in-wordpress-blocks-on-the-front-end/\"><strong>Rendering External API Data in WordPress Blocks on the Front End</strong></a>, <strong>Manoj Kumar</strong> shows you how to build a dynamic block that fetches data from an external API and renders it on the frontend when a particular block is dropped into the Block Editor of a post. He uses the create-block scaffolding tool to get started, fetches data with <code>useEffect()</code> and store the data in the database and retrieves for the block rendering on the front end. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s master branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. <br />Have you been using it?

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 14.2 and 14.3 plugin releases, WordPress 6.1 release candidate, style variations in the theme directory as a beta, a developer course on Gutenberg data layer, and so much more. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And my guest today is Dave Smith, a JavaScript engineer and full-time core contributor on the Gutenberg project, sponsored by Automattic. Good afternoon, Dave. Thanks for joining me today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Hi, Birgit. Yeah, I&#8217;m doing really well, thank you. And it&#8217;s great to be able to join you on the show again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, although you have been a guest on the Change Log before we always get new listeners. And so maybe you could tell us briefly about yourself and what you are working on at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, sure. I&#8217;m a developer living from and working in England in the United Kingdom. And as you mentioned before, I&#8217;m sponsored by Automattic and I work full-time on the Gutenberg Project. So my primary focus tends to be the navigation project, which I&#8217;ve been on for the 6.1 cycle, and that&#8217;s now encompassing all aspects of managing navigation in the editor, including the nav block. I also run a YouTube channel, which is Dave on WP, where I post regular videos on all aspects of the block editor. And most recently I&#8217;ve been working on an overview video for all the key features coming to WordPress 6.1, so if anyone would like to check that out, then they can have a look at the channel, which is youtube.com/c/daveonwp, and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have that link in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, of course we do put a link in the show notes. Yeah, and I found great videos about the work on the navigation block there. They were very helpful getting into the problem space and why it&#8217;s all so difficult to solve. So thanks for putting them together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: No problem, yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Oh, there was also another video, I watched your presentation that you gave to an agency team that is starting out adopting the block editor for their work, and they had some interesting questions for you. So what was your takeaway from the discussions with the group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, so that was the discussion I had with Corner Shop Creative, I believe. Yeah, they were brilliant, they were such a great team. They had loads of questions, I think the Q&amp;A ended up being longer than the actual presentation itself, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, it was a good thing. I always think it&#8217;s a good sign. But that team had, they really fully embraced the block editor, but they&#8217;re butting up against some of the same problems we hear a lot about, styling and curation of content. An example that came up was this possibility of having a synced block pattern, which could be updated with styling changes after the fact. As you know, once you insert a pattern, it&#8217;s a one time action. Once it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s done. You can&#8217;t go back and then update it. So every time the client wants to update their styles, they have to go through all of the instances of the pattern and update them so you that you can see how that&#8217;d be a bit of a headache.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t see any really good way to deal with that yet apart from inheriting all the styles from global styles instead of applying bespoke ones to the pattern itself. But it&#8217;s certainly a tricky problem anyway, it illustrates that we still have some ways to go to solve all these real world use cases that folks are running up against.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, updating prior work was actually a pain point that I also heard at WordCamp Europe as well as WordCamp US, where it&#8217;s not only the pattern but it&#8217;s also when you have a theme that was modified, the template was modified, when the theme is updated through a theme shop, the user doesn&#8217;t get the new templates because they override it through their user stuff. That also a good problem to solve because if they update the template and. although it was changed by the user, they&#8217;re not getting the new features in there, whatever that&#8217;s in there. So it&#8217;s kind of a tricky bit there. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, you mentioned it, let&#8217;s discuss WordPress 6.1 release cycle for a bit before we head into the Gutenberg plugin releases. Do you want to start out with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. So I think we&#8217;ve had the RC1 on the 11th of October, 2022. We&#8217;re recording on the 14th, I think, today. So yeah, it&#8217;s time to perform those final reviews and get testing on that. As usual, we don&#8217;t recommend running this on a production or mission critical website, I think we all know that by now, but just in case. And we&#8217;ve got the final release of this 6.1 is going to be out on the 1st of November, 2022, all being well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s some people who say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to update until 6.1.1 is out,&#8221; but yeah, I hear there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, well, I mean there&#8217;s absolutely loads of changes in this release. I think there&#8217;s some stat of 1,700 PRs merged or something like that, so there&#8217;s absolutely a load of features coming down the line. But also bug fixes and tooling and testing changes, I think it&#8217;s going to be a really strong release. Do you agree?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah, there are countless changes for the content creators, and we talked about those in the last six or seven episodes when we discuss the Gutenberg plugin releases. But so almost all features from the plugin releases 13.1 through 14.1 will make it or made it into the WordPress 6.1. It&#8217;s already, as you said, in release candidate. So feature freeze was beta one, release candidate one is actually string free. So the army of polyglot contributors that translate all the new things coming to WordPress between now and the final release can be sure that they don&#8217;t have to do it again when there are additional string changes there. So that&#8217;s string free. So it&#8217;s pretty clear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are two or three things that didn&#8217;t make it in there as I discovered, there was a zoom out window, the table of contents block is not in 6.1, and also the theme support for the appearance tool for classic themes that didn&#8217;t make it into 6.1. They need some more testing or some more refinement before it goes out to millions of users. And I just realized that 6.0, WordPress 6.0, was already downloaded a hundred million times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Wow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the counter resets in about a month&#8230; No, about two weeks, for 6.1, but then we know the final number. So the field guide for WordPress 6.1 has been published and I counted 19 developer notes about the block editor and block based themes, that&#8217;s double the amount of developer notes for 6.0. There&#8217;s also a separate field guide for performance update from the performance team. Awesome work there. And also a separate post that lists all the accessibility changes coming to WordPress 6.1 by Anne McCarthy, and I think she lists about 50 different changes that were coming. So Dave, what are the features that you are most excited about this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Oh, there&#8217;s so much. I&#8217;ve just been going through all these changes for WordPress 6.1 actually, and there&#8217;s just so many great things. But I think probably the biggest thing that I think people will notice when they download 6.1 for the first time is just how many more design tools are available across the blocks in 6.1. There&#8217;s been a big push throughout the 6.1 cycle to roll out all the standardized tools for blocks for things like color, typography, layout, spacing, and that kind of thing. And I think now that&#8217;s really coming to fruition. I think we&#8217;re only 50% of the way through all the blocks apparently, I read the last ticket, but it&#8217;s surprising what a difference that makes compared to 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. And I actually put, I&#8217;m so excited about it, I put a table together with all the core blocks and so you can see all the core blocks and then typography, color controls, dimension controls, border controls, and layer controls, and then you see which block has what. So that&#8217;s in the dev nodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Oh, that sounds brilliant. Yeah, I&#8217;ll have to look that up. Yeah, well the other thing I wanted to have to talk about was the&#8230; Something that I think will help increase adoption rates for block editing, and that&#8217;s the ability to utilize and edit template parts in classic themes. And first time I heard it I thought, &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the point of that? It sounds a bit strange.&#8221; But actually I found that it affords a lot of power, because what it enables you to do is things like make your header or your footer fully editable whilst not requiring our users to have to fully deal with and embrace the full site editor experience. So I was testing this out and I had to go at converting the 2020 theme to allow me to be able to edit the footer. And it was so easy to do, but yet it opened up such an amazing thing because normally if you want to edit just something as simple as the text and the footer, you&#8217;d have to create an option and create a new setting in your theme and do all that sort of thing. And now you can just go in and at the footer text, click save, and it&#8217;s done. And so actually I think it&#8217;s a bigger win than you might expect when you hear that for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And Justin Tadlock actually did a little tutorial when he did the same thing that you did. I think he converted the 20&#8230; No, he converted the 2021 with some block parts and had a hero image of the header and all that. So that is actually published several weeks ago at the Gutenberg Times website. So I will add that link also to the show notes. But it goes really through the whole problems that he encountered also with CSS, because sometimes you need to update the things and that&#8217;s expected, but also how little there was to update. And he also added a few patterns to it and how you can do that. So that&#8217;s a great tutorial if you want to check that out. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Absolutely. Justin&#8217;s articles are always really good, isn&#8217;t it? So I&#8217;ll definitely be looking at that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: There&#8217;s one more thing actually you want to call out, if I may.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: And this one, I think, has flown slightly under the radar on this release, but it&#8217;s actually the syncing of editor preferences across devices. So I mean you&#8217;ll be familiar that you can do things like set the persistent list view or you want top toolbar mode within the editor. But in 6.0 these rules just saved locally to the device you were on. So if you went and then switched to a new device, all those changes would be lost, you&#8217;d have to reapply those references, which is kind of annoying. So with 6.1, however, they&#8217;ve now updated it so the changes are saved to the database. So that means that they&#8217;re going to apply across all your devices. So if you&#8217;re at work and you set top toolbar mode at work, you come home, log onto your home laptop, and it&#8217;s going to be exactly the same there. So it&#8217;s a nice quality of life improvement then. And big shout out to Daniel Richards who really spearheaded all the work in that area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think there will be a sigh of relief for millions of block editor users that have said, &#8220;Yeah, I know the welcome guide. Yeah, go away. Let me go on with my work.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really a great. But I also feel that it&#8217;s the right time to actually implement that because now the full range of preference tools is actually known. And then also figure out, okay, how all these editor, being the site editor, being the post editor. Yeah, how they handle those preference tools before you&#8217;re actually put it persistently in a database. I think that&#8217;s a good&#8230; The local storage was a good solution for interim, but now that it&#8217;s in a database now plugins and others can actually also know about that and help them modify that. So for developers in 6.1, there are great improvements on the controls for theme JSON, of course the typography and border controls and color for links coming also there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the most important thing that I feel is the query loop block extensions that the developer can now create a block variation for the query loop block and define, with the attributes, the customization of the list of posts, custom post types, or pages. And so theme developers working on more complex sites will hopefully make good use of that. I think the ease of style variations for theme developers is also&#8230; You can use them for classic themes. No, we talked about that. Yeah, style variations for the block themes are definitely good, coming to 6.1. They were actually for 6.0 already there, the default theme has it. But the default theme now is actually a base theme and now has 10 variations built from the community that come with a default theme. So I&#8217;m really excited about that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a pretty amazing thing, that 2023 theme, I think something like 38 contributions and ended up being with 10 different variations. Amazing. A new way of generating default themes for WordPress. I think it really points to the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m not sure if you should just keep that default theme, kind of change the name to default theme and just add variations in every area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: There&#8217;s variations now. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And do a shout out to the community and say, &#8220;Okay, now it&#8217;s time to show us the best variations,&#8221; and then we add it to them theme or something like that. I also saw theme developers that submitted quite a few style variations, build a child theme, and submitted that to the repository with their style variations in it. So you get, even if the design team just selected 10 of them, you get to see even more style variations for it. So it&#8217;s definitely quite some creativity going on in the community about that. Which brings us to our community contributions section of the site. Dave, you brought some with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I found quite a few community contributions this week, actually. So the first one I want to chat is about is client side web assembly, WordPress with no server. It&#8217;s sort of a click bait-y title if I ever heard one. But this was a post on make blog by Adam Zielinski. And what it is is it is what it says on the tin, WordPress running completely in the browser with no web server whatsoever. And probably most of your listeners will be familiar with WordPress, traditionally you have a web server and your browser sends&#8230; When you click on something like posts, it&#8217;s going to send a request to that server and the server&#8217;s going to respond with the answer. But of course if something happens like you go offline, then you can&#8217;t reach the server anymore, and therefore your site doesn&#8217;t work. And that&#8217;s always how WordPress has worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Adam&#8217;s done is been very, very clever and he&#8217;s used the technology called web assembly, which is a low level assembly like language similar to C or C++ or whatever. And basically what he&#8217;s done is he&#8217;s taken the PHP that comprises the WordPress software, compiled it down to web assembly, packaged it up in a bundle, and then run it completely in the browser. Then any requests that go out that would normally go out to WordPress get trapped by a service worker and it get reroutes them to this in browser version of WordPress. Sounds all very, very clever and you think, &#8220;Oh well, great experiment,&#8221; but it&#8217;s actually got some real world opportunities there, I think. Especially around learning WordPress in the browser. I don&#8217;t know if you saw that post, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, I actually reviewed it and had some questions for Adam before he published it. And I also tested some of the things. So it&#8217;s really amazing and I can imagine the opportunities are probably endless, but definitely when you have tutorial type posts, you can add that to it and people can then, in real time, make some changes to the code that they&#8217;re just learning or just reading about and then see how it impacts a website without having to spin up their own local, without any build tools, without any downloading of Gutenberg or something like that to see that all happening. And so it&#8217;s a much faster way to learn and see how things working, instead of&#8230; And then figure out how you add it to your own code. Yeah, yeah, so really I hope&#8230; And I saw Adam in between announcing, I ran into some browser freezes and browser&#8230; Because the bundle, of course, is also pretty big. If you have downloaded WordPress before, it&#8217;s about four or five megabits. And if you load that in a browser and in your memory of your local system, yeah, you need some heavy lifting there. And if you do some more, it kind of poops out on you, so to speak. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean that&#8217;s definitely why I think this is a first sort of prototype. I know Adam and colleagues are looking for people to start contributing and trying to make this more practical in real word usage. So if anyone is interested in that, then the link to that post will be in the show notes for this episode. I&#8217;m also going to be diving into the topic a little bit greater detail with Adam on my YouTube channel, so if you&#8217;re interested in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, right, yeah. Excellent, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I&#8217;m sure you can see that video at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, looking forward to that, yeah. So another community contribution is actually that the Meta team just released a beta version of displaying style variation in the theme directory. There&#8217;s a track ticket that was opened by Carolina Nemark, a full site editing expert if you need one. And so you can browse examples with a 2022 theme. I put the link in there. So the developer Steve Dufresne commented on the ticket, so to turn on the feature add ?beta-style_variations to the URL. And then the URL gets updated when you browse themes. So you&#8217;ll need to re-add that string, however, for each theme page to reload.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I really like is that it&#8217;s now an increase of interactivity on the theme directory to help site owners to decide which theme they want to take. And every time you click on the little style variation card underneath the screenshot, the screenshot actually changes into displaying that style variation on the screenshot. So it&#8217;s quite fascinating and I&#8217;ve spent quite some time browsing themes that already have style variations in there. So if you don&#8217;t see a style variation, probably the theme doesn&#8217;t have some, but you find the best way&#8230; I saw maybe six or seven themes in there, but of course I didn&#8217;t browse all 160 block themes anymore. But yeah, try it out. I put the link to the track ticket into the show notes, so you can also see the string that you need to add there and a link to the 2022 theme so you can see all the style variations without downloading it. Yeah, let me know what you think about it. Yeah, I&#8217;m totally stoked about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, sounds really good. Well, the more themes that are adding these style variations, the more we&#8217;re going to need to have stuff like that in the theme directory. Yeah, great to see that happening. One more thing, community contributions this week is a new course on Learn.WordPress, which is the official sort of tutorial site for WordPress. And this is a new course on WordPress data layer and specifically the Gutenberg data layer. So for those who don&#8217;t know, the data layer is used throughout the block editor to read and write data. So for example, if you need a list of posts or you want to create new post, edit a post, you&#8217;re going to need to use the data layer at some point. And really that means it&#8217;s essential learning if you want to make anything more than the most basic of blocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a full course which covers not only the basics of the data layer but also best practices and some more advanced usages. I know the author, again, it&#8217;s Adam Zielinski, who&#8217;s been prolific recently. And he&#8217;s extremely knowledgeable in this topic so I&#8217;m confident there&#8217;ll be a great investment for anyone who&#8217;s got the time to look at that course. And the link, again, is going to be in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s great for any developer who has ambition in that. Yeah, definitely requires an advanced JavaScript and req knowledge to get through that course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, but not everybody is there yet. So very soon, hopefully in the upcoming weeks, there&#8217;s an introduction to block development course coming up. And it gets you from almost zero to block building a real life example, like a multi-column block when you have a text and then it kind of distributes itself over the multiple columns. So yeah, this is the Adam Zielinski fan show because Adam Zielinski also send in, I think, three dev notes on Monday that we were able to put in the field guide. So there&#8217;s definitely some great work for developers in the works or in the 6.1.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so that brings us to the Gutenberg plugin releases 14.2 and 14.3. Let&#8217;s start with 14.2, release lead was Michal Czaplinski, who also published a release post on Make Blog, and of course another show note link. It entailed about 80 PRs, 15 enhancements, 24 bug fixes amongst them. And some of them even made it into the release candidate 6.1 that were back ported to the core. It&#8217;s a fairly small release now compared to the last two releases. I remember 14.1 had over 383 PRs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s not quite that big.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was quite epic. But of course there was a rush to get all the features in to make the feature freeze of beta one. And then nevertheless, there are great enhancements, made it into the plugin. And Dave, what are the key features that were merged in the plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, so for 14.2 we had smarter pattern suggestions for the query loop block variations, we&#8217;ve got improvements to the writing flow, a more polished calendar block, new banners and footers, block pattern categories, and auto completion for links is now in all blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that sounds terrific. So let&#8217;s discuss them one at a time. So there is also letter spacing for the global styles, so you can now, for the heading, and you can now put them in the theme JSON file to have not only letter spacing but also font family selection and the other typography, which is letter like height, case for the headings like sentence case or title case or no case at all. So that&#8217;s all for the headings. And I think the letter spacing didn&#8217;t make it into 6.1, the others you find in the headings. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: We&#8217;ve also got another PR, which is switching us to using numbers instead of T-shirt sizing for labels for spacing presets. So if you&#8217;re changing something like padding or margin, there&#8217;s a little slider and you can slide between small, medium, large, extra large. That was deemed to be too complex, potentially, and had some accessibility concerns, so they&#8217;ve reversed just numbers, so zero, one, two, three, four, five.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It&#8217;s simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s simpler, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And there is another quality of life change that made it into, and that is hiding the floating block UI when typing. It was always going away but it now also hides the insert, so there is no distraction coming up when you type on a paragraph block or in any other blocks for that matter. I think that&#8217;s really important because that&#8217;s one of the big concerns for writers, that there is so much distraction, especially when they start out, every time they move the mouse something appears and then there&#8217;s gone until they see what it was. And it&#8217;s kind of disconcerting sometimes for writers when they start out with the block editor. So I like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The color block also got now color support in 14.2, and polish styles, which is nice because I think the color block&#8230; Calendar block, color block. Sorry, let&#8217;s do that again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Can you say it again?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Calendar block got now color support and polish style. And I&#8217;m really happy that the calendar block got some more love now because I think that&#8217;s the first change since the beginning of the&#8230; Just the last five years since the calendar block actually made it into the block editor. So that&#8217;s just really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s nice to see. Under patterns we&#8217;ve also got new categories, as I mentioned, for banners and footers. The reason we&#8217;ve got those is because we&#8217;ve already got the headers category for patterns, but that was really intended for more global elements that might be at the top of your site. But unfortunately people were putting in things like what you might call a hero section, sort of a standout call out within the flow of the page, and that wasn&#8217;t really the right place to put it. So to disambiguate those, they&#8217;ve created a new pattern category called banners and you can put all your hero sections in there as you wish. There&#8217;s also another one called footers, I think that does what it says on the tin, it&#8217;s just complimentary to headers really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yes. Yeah. And those are the perfect candidate for actually classic themes to use in their themes, is the headers and footers. But the pattern category is something, it&#8217;s a little bit different. But there are also template parts that go with that. And isn&#8217;t there a semantic recognizing that if there is somebody edits the footer or the header, they get the respective category of patterns for choices in the editor? So I think that was also a reason, definitely for the footer pattern category. So the footer template part can have their own patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, and to suggest the most appropriate pattern for you. Yeah, that sounds like a good reason for that change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Another change was a link auto completer that is enabled for the blocks. Is that the&#8230; Oh, right, right. We talked about that. That&#8217;s the bracket bracket auto completer where it shows you, you just put in bracket bracket in the paragraph and in the list block and now in all blocks and you get a choice of the latest published posts or pages that you have on your site. That&#8217;s a very fast way to do inner links on your site, which actually help you with SEO as well, but also keep your reader on the site. So this is a great tool to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s good to see that in all blocks now, not just the paragraph block. Especially with the new list and blocks having inner blocks, so that&#8217;s quite important there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it was missing from the list block actually.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I used that quite a bit on the Gutenberg Times the list block where I have just a list of links and all of a sudden it didn&#8217;t work anymore. So guess what I did?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Oh, I can guess. So next up, we&#8217;re onto the block live section and there&#8217;s been quite a number of enhancements to blocks. The main one is the query loop block now suggests patterns based on the active variation. So for this one, imagine if you have a query loop block, you might register a variation for it for something like listing out a list of products from your products custom post type. But that variation itself can also register patterns. So you might have a pattern, which is the list layout, and then another pattern which is list products in the grid. So you&#8217;ve got those two patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happens now is when you insert your products list variation, it will suggest to you those two patterns that the variation is registered. So it&#8217;s surfacing the most appropriate pattern for your query loop variation. And that&#8217;s quite powerful for things like e-commerce sites and things like that. So you&#8217;re not getting loads and loads of patterns you have to pick from that are completely irrelevant to the type of query loop you are inserting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s one of the features that quite a few agencies really love because they can narrow down the customization that a user can do and be very strict in certain things, but give a little bit of freedom. That also pairs with the content locking features that come with 6.1. I know I&#8217;m jumping back and forth, but it all comes together in one thing, in that it will be the, it&#8217;s the site editor thing. Yeah. So yeah, there also it was a great writing flow, a fix for it. Now when you partial select between blocks there and now you can drag it again, which wasn&#8217;t possible before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, you had, when you were dragging from one across a number of blocks, it would have this strange effect where it would go back to showing you the first block you&#8217;d dragged. So if you had a sidebar open as you would drag in between the blocks, it would flash between the first block and then the multi-select, the first block, the multi-select. And now what happens is just when you start, you click on the first block you drag and the toolbar and everything around it stays based on the first block that you selected. It&#8217;s a small change you probably wouldn&#8217;t notice, but if you were doing a lot of multi-selection, especially with drag and click and drag, you would definitely notice it flickering back and forth. It was really, really distracting. So that&#8217;s just another nice quality of life improvement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, thank you for pointing that out. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Another one was when you&#8217;re creating templates in the editor, under the template screen. Previously you could, accidentally, if you were a bit overzealous with your clicking, you might create a number of templates because you could just repeatedly click the create button for any of the templates. So yeah, people were ending up with five versions of the one template and just thinking, &#8220;Well, how did that happen? I only clicked once.&#8221; So yeah, we&#8217;ve fixed that so it&#8217;s not possible to do that anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a nice fix there because it&#8217;s disconcerting for anybody who has that. And then the last one for 14.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, under testing we have&#8230; Under storybook. Now this is quite interesting, they&#8217;ve set up a new development aid which adds visual regression testing to the components in storybook. So components are like the low level UI components that we use to build the editor as a whole, not just blocks, but everything as a whole. And storybook showcases those in one place. And what they&#8217;ve done is they set up a visual dipping tool. So you run the test, it takes a screenshot of your component at a point in time, and then the next time you run the test it takes another screenshot and says, &#8220;Is this different to the previous one?&#8221; And if a certain threshold difference is passed, then it flags it up and says, &#8220;This test has failed,&#8221; and then a human comes along and looks at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it caught my eye because I thought, &#8220;Wow, this could be something that we could extrapolate out to maybe other parts of the editor,&#8221; like actual blocks themselves. Because with the best rule in the world, you&#8217;re can have all sorts of end-to-end tests and unit tests and all sorts of things like that. But the end of the day a lot of things are visual changes that only a human can notice. So if we&#8217;ve got this extra step of automation picking up on these things, it might help. Currently this is only running locally, it&#8217;s not running on continuous integration on GitHub, but maybe in the future someone could take that and run with it and maybe it could help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s a really great idea. I think that is something that developers who learn how to work with a block editor definitely can use that in their local development into figuring out, &#8220;Okay, what changed now? Yeah, what did I do wrong?&#8221; In the debugging parts, they don&#8217;t need to look at the console first when they see something like that. And they build visual regression into their own components that are based on the storybook components. So we are at the end of the Gutenberg plugin version 14.2. What did Gutenberg 14.3 bring to us?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: So 14.3 we had release lead Aaron Robertshaw and he&#8217;s posted the what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 14.3 post on Make Blog. And WP Tavern have also covered this in Gutenberg 14.3 improves image drag and drop. And those links will be in the show notes. Let&#8217;s take a look at the change log, what have we got first here, Birgit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, first up is the post author blog now includes an option to link actually to the author archive, and this is definitely something that was&#8230; It&#8217;s a small tweak and it was probably a good first issue, but it&#8217;s definitely helping a lot of sites that have multiple authors to use it in the templates. Because then you also can, so you have an author archive and then when you template that you can also, there was one change in one of the other plugins that you can actually add the description that comes from the user database about the buyers, put it on top. So you have the author, you have the description, and then the list of all the blocks that now you can do link to that page from each host when you add the post author block to the post template. It&#8217;s a lot of templates and blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Well, I can see that it&#8217;s a small change, but I think it&#8217;s pretty handy for sites that produce a lot of content. I suppose the Gutenberg Times in fact would be one example of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: The next change we&#8217;ve got is we&#8217;re now using the tools panel in global styles. The typography panel is quite complex, as we mentioned before, it&#8217;s got things like letter spacing, case, all sorts of things you can change on typography these days. What it&#8217;s doing is now bringing the global styles interface into line with the typography interface that appears in blocks. So if you need to reset all the changes that you&#8217;ve made to typography across the entire site, on like a heading block, it&#8217;s now really easy to do that through a standard interface, which is a nice win there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah. And now the feature that was grabbing the attention of Sarah Gooding at the WP Tavern is to allow an image to drop into an empty paragraph block and to create an image block. I think I intuitively thought that was already possible, but maybe I just dragged it between blocks. So now you can, every time you just hit enter on at the end of one block, you can just drag your image into an empty paragraph and it adds it to the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I expect there&#8217;s probably instances where container blocks have a paragraph block as the default, so now you can just plug an image into that. That&#8217;s probably why it helps a lot as well. So yeah, nice little enhancement there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s great. Especially for the cover block, and group block, I can see that, yeah. Yeah, the next one&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: The next one is improvements to the writing flow, we&#8217;re now implementing of standardized controls that feel quite natural when you compare them with other text editors. So you can now hold down the alt key and use the arrow keys to jump around in blocks of text. So an example given is if your cursor is towards the end of a long paragraph, you can press alt and up arrow to move straight back to the beginning of that paragraph. And similarly, alt down arrow will move you to the end of that block of text. And these are all small little tweaks to the writing flow, but it does allow you to move quickly around text and brings Gutenberg into line with many other normal text editors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think this was very missed for those who use other text editors too, because it throws you when your shift or control and left arrow doesn&#8217;t get you to the beginning of the line and you need to use the mouse to get there. So yeah, I really love that writing flow improvement there. So the next one, it&#8217;s the WP HTML tag processor, I think you need to explain to me and our listeners what that actually does, Dave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I&#8217;ll give it a good go. Yes, this is a technical change, but one that is important for people who are working with dynamic blocks. So often dynamic blocks, the ones that use PHP to output the content to the front of the site, because they&#8217;ve got some sort of dynamic requirements and they have to list a post or grab your, I don&#8217;t know, post site logo or something like that. In fact, the site logo&#8217;s a good example because there&#8217;s an attribute to control whether the site logo should be a link or not. And if it isn&#8217;t going to be a link, then we need some way to strip out the anchor tag from the resulting html.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And before this processor was added, we had to do this with what&#8217;s called regular expressions, which are notoriously unreliable for parsing and modifying html. And this was happening across a number of blocks and the use cases were getting ever more complex, especially around things like using the post featured image in the mark of the cover block for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what we&#8217;ve done here is we&#8217;ve added this HTML tag processor, which is a very standardized way to walk through the HTML of a given block, and then allow you to make common modifications to it, such as adding or removing class names. Seems like a small thing, but actually unlocks many, many doors and greatly simplifies working with blocks. Not only for core blocks like cover, gallery, and heading, but of course third party blocks can also take advantage of this now and avoid having to write lots of regex, which of course no one likes doing as far as I&#8217;m aware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that because it improves so much the developer experience for the block editor and it&#8217;s such a nice tool to be a little bit more secure about what you&#8217;re changing. And if something else is in there, does it screw up your edit or your plugin for instance, or the block? Yeah. So yeah, I&#8217;m really looking forward to the dev note for that, it won&#8217;t come until 6.2 and we don&#8217;t know yet what the planning is for next year, but I know that the leadership is working on all the things that come with 6.2, so we will soon have some information about that. But yes, this is definitely&#8230; Try it out, it&#8217;s in plugin 14.3, so the team definitely would need some feedback on that to see if it actually lives up to its expectation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then we have some more changes in the block library and one is also for the image and the team fixed the crop area aspect ratio for when you rotate an image and you crop it, that it keeps the aspect ratio for it. So it&#8217;s a nice change and it keeps you a little bit more safe when you do cropping on your images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. The next one is another fix and it is for link colors in some theme contexts, specifically 2022. There was an issue whereby if an ancestor of the navigation block set a link color, then it would override any text color set on the navigation block, which is really, really confusing because say you had a, I don&#8217;t know, a green link color set on an a parent root block and you had red text color set in your navigation, you&#8217;d be seeing the green color in the editor thinking, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s happened?&#8221; You wouldn&#8217;t know where this color&#8217;s coming from. It ended up being a temporary patch has being put in to basically increase the specificity of the CSS. But in the longer term we&#8217;re looking to migrate the nav block to use standardized color controls, but it&#8217;s a lot more complex than you&#8217;d imagine. But yeah, if you&#8217;d been experiencing that problem in your theme, then you hopefully shouldn&#8217;t have that problem anymore as of 14.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that problem was on both ends, editor and front end?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, good to fix, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. And there&#8217;s a next one, which is to re-add styles that were removed from classic themes. Why would we remove styles from classic themes, you ask? Well, obviously it was an accident. Basically a lot of the core styles have been moved to theme JSONs so that we can pass them programmatically, but in doing so some of the styles for buttons were lost and no longer output, which meant that classic themes had blank buttons for a little bit. So now those are in a separate style sheet and buttons are back looking nice again for classic themes by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m just going through that, and yes, that had been ported back, I think to&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure, is that ported back to WordPress 6.1? It looks like it but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I assumed that it had, if not, I think it has&#8230; Yes, it has been back ported to 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good thing, yes. So 6.1 is not having some backwards compatibility issues with classic themes, so that&#8217;s definitely a good thing. And then there were quite a few code quality changes that updates some of the tooling and linking code. Linting is when&#8230; Oh, maybe you would explain it better than I do, Dave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It&#8217;s just programmatically checking your code for common formatting changes. So WordPress requires you to have a space around parentheses, for example, so it will automatically check those and fix them for you. That&#8217;s linting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the reason behind removing lodash dependencies from some of the JavaScript, I think was performance reasons, right? That it increased performance when you don&#8217;t need to load lodash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, lodash is a fairly sizable library, so there&#8217;s an effort underway to completely remove that dependency, which should reduce the bundle size going to the editor, which is always a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. Speaking of tools, there&#8217;s another&#8230; It&#8217;s not a tool thing. There was quite a few discussions around the experimental APIs that made it into the WordPress code base, but now there is&#8230; Adam Zielinski actually put a proposal together on how to limit that access and the first version of it is now available in the Gutenberg plugin. Do you have some more information behind that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, so experimental APIs were quite controversial because Gutenberg does need to iterate and move quite quickly compared to core, for example. And so they often introduce experimental APIs and they&#8217;re not guaranteed to be stable and might break at any time. But of course some of these APIs were ending up going into a core WordPress release because they hadn&#8217;t been stabilized at the point that WordPress was released. And that was understandably something that we didn&#8217;t want to happen because WordPress has a commitment to backwards compatibility, so you can&#8217;t really have experimental APIs going into a core release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a middle ground had to be found between those two positions, one, that Gutenberg needs to iterate quickly, and number two, that core needs to not have breaking changes in it, which is entirely legitimate. So the way that this has been done now is from now on, if Gutenberg wants to expose experimental APIs views within its code base, it has to do so quite explicitly. You have to go through a number of quite laborious steps to do so, which is important. And number two, if you are a plugin developer and you choose to consume and experimental APIs, you also have to jump through a number of code hoops in order to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of which actually requires you to type in, manually, a string of text which says something to the effect of, &#8220;I know that using this experimental API will break my plugin on the next release,&#8221; or something along those lines. I mean, we laugh, but the point is that it is to educate people that if you do use this, it&#8217;s it is at your own risk. And I like to think this is quite a nice middle ground between the two positions and hopefully we&#8217;ll see it come to a fruition in the next couple of releases as the current experimental APIs are stabilized and all future ones have to go through this complex setup state in order to be exposed anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it wouldn&#8217;t so much be hard if only the Gutenberg plugin, that it would use the experimental APIs. But I think because most plugin developers that adopted block development also looked at the source code of the plugin and learned how, &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s see how the core developer do that.&#8221; And they used that experimental API in their own plugins for many, many years now. And now that&#8217;s really hard to deprecate. If just WordPress using it, it would be easier to deprecate that because nobody else uses it and everybody would know how to change that. But because they are not only the plug-ins that are in the repository, they are plugins that are done by freelancers and agencies for their sites that are third-party plugins that are not in the repo might be using it. So that backwards compatibility promise is really something that needs to&#8230; Though the experimental APIs cannot be deprecated without breaking those and it also cannot be it need, they actually should need to be documented if third-party use them. But the nature of experimental API is actually not documented and can disappear at any time. But that is not possible when they&#8217;re in WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, so there is a solution coming out and I think there is a lot of&#8230; We talked about it before maybe with&#8230; I&#8217;m not quite sure. On the Change Log before when for 6.0 when there were, I don&#8217;t know, 280 experimental APIs that are merged at the core. Some of them are really only used for the Gutenberg plugin or the block editor, but some of them were actually used in the wider ecosystem. So speaking of JavaScript library, there&#8217;s the next feature is remove enzyme completely, and enzyme is a react testing library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes, that&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. But now react has created their own testing library, so that&#8217;s why it doesn&#8217;t have to be bundled anymore, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. I mean, we would be using these two testing libraries on our components, one was enzyme and the other one is react testing library. And react testing library, which is built on top of react&#8217;s own library, has its own nicer encourages you to test things in a&#8230; More experiencing them how the user would interact with the component, so it encourages better accessibility practices, et cetera. So it made sense to standardize towards one. So finally, after lots of work by lots of contributors, enzyme has been removed. And now if you want to test your components, you should use react testing library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Yeah. And in the PR, there are also some code examples on how to do this for your own code, what you need to do in terms of taking out enzyme and using react library, so check out the PR 44494. And of course it&#8217;s on the change log for 14.3. So this concludes 14.3 and our Gutenberg plugin releases and we&#8217;ve come to the things that we discuss what&#8217;s still an active development, but what might come or will come to the Gutenberg plugin in the near future. Dave, you are part of the navigation project, almost exclusively, what is in store for the navigation project?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Well, we&#8217;ve just rounded off the 6.1 cycle, we&#8217;re moving into thinking about 6.2. And there&#8217;s been a number of priorities suggested on the navigation tracking issue, which we&#8217;ll put a link to in the show notes, about what we should focus on for the 6.2 cycle for navigation in the block editor, including the navigation block. The proposal is at the moment to put a specific focus on editing and managing menus within the editor itself. It sounds obvious, but previous 6.1 is focused more on importing menus and automatic fallback behavior. Whereas this one is we&#8217;re going to try and actually the editing and managing of menus themselves. So there&#8217;s that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re also going to be working on foundational issues and improving tests for better reliability and some more under the hood technical changes such as moving from in IDs to slugs when you&#8217;re relating a navigation menu to a block. So we&#8217;re looking for feedback on those proposals, so if anyone wants to input, please go along to that tracking issue and comment and we&#8217;d be only too glad to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So there was, at the beginning of I think 5.8 or something like that, there was the idea to actually have a navigation screen also for organizing menus. Is it an idea to go back to that? Or is it all kind of happening in the sidebar? Do you know what the approach is going to be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes. Yeah. I mean, the current thinking is that having a separate navigation editor screen, there was an experiment for that for a while in the plugin, that&#8217;s now been disabled, there&#8217;s no plan to continue to work on that. But instead the idea is to bring that ability to manage multiple menus into the editor canvas itself. If you think about things like templates and template parts, you can do that all within the editor, there&#8217;s focus modes for template parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same thing will hopefully apply to navigation, so you&#8217;ll be able to manage an individual navigation block and it&#8217;s associated menu within the editor within the block itself. But also if you have lots of other menus and you want to edit one that isn&#8217;t on the canvas, for example, there will be a global navigation sidebar that you can pop open from that W WordPress menu on the top left and there you&#8217;ll be able to choose the different menus and move things around, edit them, things like that. And so the foundational work for that should be going into 6.2, the actual screen may not appear in 6.2 but at least the foundational work will be going in to make that possible. So yeah, that&#8217;s the state of play on that particular aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you to elaborate on that. And then, so Andrew Sorong has also created a new tracking issue for the layout options that are going to come after 6.1. And layouts are the ones that, for all the layout options, design tools and other refinements. And 6.1 comes with three layouts now, the flow layout, the flex layout, and the constraint layout, making it possible so the inner blocks are following their parents, so to speak, in that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also additional improvements in the works. One was the fixed positions for head and footer template parts, meaning it&#8217;s stuck to the top or to the bottom. Also have some more layout consistencies, like an ad layout support to the cover block. Also some minor things like allow the change block cap in the editor and all that. So we&#8217;ll have that link also in the show notes, so the tracking issue, so you see what the team is working on and what they have on their priority list so you can follow along and also give input. It&#8217;s really important that people test along the way so it gets a more stable version of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Ooh, I&#8217;m excited about fixed position head and footer template parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: A lot of people ask me about that for navigation, so I can imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can imagine, yeah. So yeah, it seems that we are at the end of our show today. And I&#8217;m so happy, Dave, that you joined me today on going through the two change logs and talk about WordPress 6.1 and all these great tools that you brought in from the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It was an absolute pleasure, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is there anything else that you wanted to alert our listeners to that we didn&#8217;t talk about before, before we close the show?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: No. Actually, I think we&#8217;ve covered quite a lot in this show. So no, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, we did. So when people want to reach you, how would they connect with you apart from the YouTube channel that we are going to put in the show notes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Sure. I think probably the best way is through WordPress Slack, I&#8217;m Get Dave on WordPress Slack. Feel free to send me a DM if you&#8217;d like to discuss anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. And as always, the show notes will be published on GutenbergTimes.com/podcast, this is number 74.

The company plans to adopt the concept of full-site editing in other WPZOOM themes as well, following the release of UniBlock.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>UniBlock&#8217;s default look is sporting a darker color palette in the navigation and above the fold, with a lighter background for the rest of the website. The video on the sample homepage uses the free <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpzoom-video-popup-block/\">WPZOOM Video Popup Block</a> plugin, which supports Vimeo and YouTube. It&#8217;s a simple, lightweight block that allows users to customize the play button and play icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After activating the theme, clicking on &#8216;Customize&#8217; will prompt the user to install the video plugin. It can also be converted to a Custom HTML block or removed entirely at the user&#8217;s discretion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UniBlock&#8217;s 19 custom block patterns include everything one might expect from a business theme but, most impressively, it ships with five full-page patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Front Page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>About</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Services</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blog</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contact</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, users can assign the page template in the post settings to get the same effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These full-page patterns are convenient for speedy page building. They make it possible to get a basic business website up in a matter of minutes. Here&#8217;s an example of the Services full-page pattern that will instantly embed when selected. Users can delete any sections they don&#8217;t need, add more blocks and patterns, and quickly fill in all their own information.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Separately there are patterns for a footer with text, links, multiple arrangements of featured boxes with text and button, multiple designs for call-to-action sections, pricing tables, team members with social icons, testimonials, header cover, sidebar, 404 page, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can delve even further into customizing the templates with the site editor, as UniBlock is packaged with nearly two dozen templates and template parts. Here they can also edit the menu and adjust global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WPZOOM is developing a Pro version of the theme to release in a few weeks with support for importing the whole demo, multiple color schemes, multiple demos, premium block patterns, and additional header and footer layouts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://demo.wpzoom.com/uniblock/\">Check out the demo</a> on the WPZOOM website to see the theme in action. WPZOOM has also written <a href=\"https://www.wpzoom.com/documentation/uniblock\">documentation for UniBlock</a>, which covers general topics like how to use block patterns, how to set up the front and blog pages, and how to create a menu in the site editor. Since the company&#8217;s most popular themes are what would be considered classic themes, UniBlock is new territory for most of their customers. It is so far the only block theme among WPZOOM&#8217;s collection of 31 themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block theme adoption is slowly making its way across WordPress&#8217; major theme shops and the official directory is now hosting 160 themes tagged for full-site editing. As more longtime theme companies make their block theme debuts and develop a base for future themes, WordPress users may start to see a rapid acceleration of the number and variety of block themes available. UniBlock is so far one of the few block themes in the directory with a singular focus on business websites. It is available to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/uniblock/\">download for free from WordPress.org</a> or via the admin themes panel.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 15 Oct 2022 01:00:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"Post Status: Does WordPress.org Data Belong to the WordPress Community?

Like last week\'s episode of <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> with <strong>Katie Keith</strong> of <strong>Barn2 Plugins</strong>, <strong>Till Krüss</strong> (<strong>Object Cache Pro</strong>, <strong>Relay</strong>) offers a lot of lessons this week about less travelled paths to success in the plugin business even as a very small company or company of one.

Has the WordPress.org repository become a closed shop, a tapped-out ecosystem where the winners have taken all?

That\'s a mouthful but a quick way to describe the many facets of <strong>Till Krüss</strong>&#8216;s business built around <strong>Object Cache Pro</strong>, “a business class <strong>Redis</strong> object cache backend for WordPress.” OCP offers a unique and highly successful model for partnerships between a WordPress plugin product business and two valuable niche markets: hosting companies (B2B) for $1,950/month and anyone running WordPress sites at scale (D2C) for $95/month. <strong>Nexcess</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.nexcess.net/blog/nexcess-to-provide-premium-caching-to-all-customers-with-new-object-cache-pro-partnership/\">the latest host to adopt</a> OCP, which they announced earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till’s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas and achievements are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it…) 10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease to five minutes. How? End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality. It’s an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third-party WordPress product ecosystem, Till believes — and I think he’s right about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://objectcache.pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Object Cache Pro</a> is a (closed-source) commercial product that grew out of and is developed alongside <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/\">Redis Object Cache</a>. (100k+ installs on WordPress.org, numerous forks and stars on <a href=\"https://github.com/rhubarbgroup/redis-cache\">GitHub</a>.) <strong>Redis Object Cache</strong> is a fork of an unmaintained precursor <a href=\"https://ethitter.com/2014/04/redis-object-cache-plugin-available-for-download/\"><strong>Erick Hitter</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://ttmm.io/tech/ludicrous-speed-wordpress-caching-with-redis/\"><strong>Eric Mann</strong></a> launched <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/redis-object-cache-wordpress/\">in 2014</a>. </li><li><a href=\"https://relay.so/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Relay</a> looks like it will be a successor to OCP as it\'s capable of speeds up to 100 times faster than Redis. It\'s a PHP extension developed in C that is both a Redis client and a shared in-memory cache.&#8221; There is a free Community version.</li><li><strong>Felipe Elia</strong> recently wrote a great explainer on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://felipeelia.dev/wordpress-object-cache-and-redis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress, Object Cache, and Redis</a>.

(Here I am in 2010, writing <a href=\"https://corymiller.com/why-we-need-a-premium-wordpress-plugin-market/\">Why We Need a Premium WordPress Plugin Market</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I want to do here is frame the conversation to be constructive and help us all make progress together — for the good of WordPress, plugin developers, and our members. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ll try to offer as limited a commentary as I can here because I\'d like your comments and responses to these questions: </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-1-are-plugins-essential-to-wordpress\">1. Are plugins essential to WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, have (free and paid) plugins been — and will they continue to be — essential to the health and growth of WordPress? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My answer is YES — <em>absolutely!</em> Even if it\'s a messy market. And we have work to do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of this writing, there were listed 60,229 plugins in the WP repo, and of course countless other free and paid plugins elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins are key contributions to WordPress. They extends WordPress and allows WP to stay as nimble as possible for the enormous variety of uses in our world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started iThemes in 2008. We were early in the &#8220;premium&#8221; market. We didn\'t have to depend on the repo at the time, but I would have relished the opportunity to offer and sell our products there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your answer to my first question is a solid <em>yes</em> too — and I hope it is — then my next question is:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. What can we do to create a more sustainable model and environment for WP plugin developers?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THIS</strong> is where we need to start the conversation, in my view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merely suggesting to plugin developers committed to the WP.org repository that if they don\'t like the rules or changes they should go elsewhere isn\'t fair or reasonable to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\'re saying that to plugin developers, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You don\'t own a free plugin&#8230;</li><li>You haven\'t built your business around a free plugin&#8230;</li><li>You were early into the product business like I was at iThemes in 2008&#8230;</li><li>You already have an existing platform outside of the .org repo&#8230;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8230;then at best, you\'re not putting yourself in their shoes. You\'re not offering realistic advice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also don\'t think it\'s the best or healthiest answer for them or WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I\'m talking about and asking for are ideas that make incremental progress and improvement &#8230; TOGETHER. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For WordPress and the plugin developer ecosystem to start a dialogue that is perhaps overdue. I also want to keep in mind that this is an open source project, with projects teams and volunteers who are already overloaded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we start with this question:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>What are the big three things we as a larger WP community (together) can start working toward to support WP plugin devs better?</strong></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ll offer some ideas to kick off this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let\'s agree we\'re all in this together. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s so much division and polarization in our world already today outside of WP. In the spirit of open source and WP, let\'s be a shining example to our worlds of what can be when humans start talking and listening to fellow humans. Leaving some of our past behind and simply understanding where we\'re coming from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at its simplest? <strong>Be open to the conversation. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its best? <strong>Try to embody the other\'s perspective.</strong> Getting into their shoes. Seeing from their perspective. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my favorite conversations this year was with <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bph\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></strong> at WCUS.

It\'s about time we published it as an episode of <strong>Post Status Draft</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till is the developer and owner of <strong>Object Cache Pro</strong>, &#8220;a business class <strong>Redis</strong> object cache backend for WordPress.&#8221; OCP offers a unique and highly successful model for partnerships between a WordPress plugin product business and two valuable niche markets: hosting companies (B2B) for $1950/month and anyone running WordPress sites at scale (D2C) for $95/month. <strong>Nexcess</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.nexcess.net/blog/nexcess-to-provide-premium-caching-to-all-customers-with-new-object-cache-pro-partnership/\">the latest host to adopt</a> OCP, which they announced earlier this week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>What plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it..) 10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease to five minutes. How? End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance optimization in general — and caching in particular — are <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/2022-web-almanac-cms-report/\">possibly the oldest and most persistent hard problems</a> for people running WordPress and similar applications at scale. Historically, performance has been a problem passed to the hosting industry by WordPress developers and users of too many plugins — or too many plugins that use too many server resources, especially as measured in database queries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper\">Till’s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas and achievements are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it&#8230;) 10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease to five minutes. How? End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality. It’s an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third-party WordPress product ecosystem, Till believes — and I think he’s right about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Test Everything, End-to-End</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A large part of the challenges people have with WordPress in the wild have to do with plugins that have not been built and tested to perform at scale. There’s likely a lot of opportunity in aligning people on performance as a key, common interest. What people are these? Product, agency, and hosting companies in the WordPress space. <em>And</em>, as Till’s example shows, a small WordPress company, or company of one that wants to stay that way, still can thrive today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quality Product = Nearly No Support Needs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, plugin owners have struggled with burdensome customer support, and having to resort to support as a customer is always an unwanted burden. Neither party wants to relate primarily through the support desk! So &#8230; why not just eliminate it or diminish support needs as much as possible? It\'s a win for everyone, and resources go into product development, another win-win. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and Value</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Object Cache Pro\'s sales and distribution through hosting partnerships leave support obligations with the hosting partner and their own customers. The value to hosts is how they can bundle OCP, a high-value product, at a low cost to their customers\' hosting plans. This leaves OCP focused on product development, quality assurance, and lower support/maintenance costs — which is in everyone\'s interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Object Cache Pro\'s Direct-to-Consumer pricing has no SaaS component. It does come with support, but customers are expected to install and maintain OCP themselves without an additional white-glove support plan. The value proposition: It just works and delivers incredible performance gains that have a quantifiable dollar value on high-traffic sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should we continue this conversation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you\'re interested in a follow-up</em> conversation with Till or have questions about the things we covered in this one, please get in touch.

I know that, um, Cloud Linux is using now Spin up, WP Blue Host. A lot of big hosts are using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m here with Till..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> <em>Krüss</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> &#8230;and we\'re going to be talking about Object Cache Pro, which Till launched at the end of 2019. It\'s a business class Redis Object Cache backend for WordPress that\'s used by GoDaddy, Pagely Nexus Cloud Ways, and Convesio. The free, open-source version, Redis Object Cache is available at wordpress.org on the plugin repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes WordPress much, much faster. Till\'s also building [00:01:00] Relay Redis client that\'s two orders of magnitude (100x) faster, and there are Laravel, WordPress, and Magento integrations for it. Till\'s a company of one and has a really unique view of how he wants to do business in the WordPress space. We\'ll spend some time talking about that, how Till got into WordPress in the first place as a very self-taught developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we\'ll talk about performance and testing in the WordPress plugin ecosystem. Why there needs to be more of it and why this matters to WordPress\'s Growth and competitiveness. Before we get into that, let me tell you about one of our great sponsors, Pressable. Founded in 2010. Pressable is a world class managed WordPress hosting provider built on the same data network as wordpress.com and WordPress VIP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their state of the [00:02:00] art platform empowers agencies, freelancers, e-commerce businesses, IT professionals, and WordPress developers.

It\'s a 50 50 split, more or less between object, cash, Pro and relay. Right. Which hasn\'t really, you know,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> been too public. Relay that\'s, um, how much is, is that coming back into WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s a kind of a larger PHP project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Yeah. Without, you know, diving off the deep end here, essentially, I spoke with a bunch of people. The result was Object Cash Pro. And once I released this, you know, enterprise grade object cashing solution hosting companies came to me and be like, Hey, we want even more performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last two years, me and Michael, um, mostly him, but the [00:04:00] last two years we spent building Relay because it\'s the, it\'s a nice addition. And to answer your question about, Back to WordPress is like, yes. However, we are expanding into the, The extension works with laville magenta, with all PHP frameworks, messes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s not only restricted to WordPress, but I assume this is gonna be the right dominant market. The first couple of years object. Cing is a very WordPress specific term. You see it here and there in other frameworks, but often it\'s just called caching. They just say, Hey, we just throw something into the cash and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they differentiate between page caching and all the other things. In WordPress, it\'s a specific term called object caching, but really it\'s, it\'s a, yeah, it\'s a WordPress specific thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So what, what, how would you define object caching? I have kind of a metaphor, simplification for it in my, in my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what\'s, what\'s a semi-technical. Deeper technical understanding of, of what we\'re doing [00:05:00] with object caching in, in WordPress,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> how I define it. There\'s some really good articles written out there. I think someone just posted something a few days ago. I dunno if I can pull this up right now. Um, Interesting Filipe ira.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. He just posted something. . We should put his initial notes. He has nice illustrations and he explains it. Um, essentially object hashing is you, you know, database might MariaDB all the S SQL queries that typically quite slow at scale, the more low you put on it. If you have a thousand people asking questions at the send them, it can be a bit much so at word pr Let\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to fetch the most recent comments and it gives you 20 comments instead of always asking your database server for it, you throw it into the object cash. I\'m doing air quotes here, which can be backed by many different service or architectures. In my case with object [00:06:00] cash Pros, cuz I think it\'s a really neat piece of software home and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of, you know, the next couple of visitors, they don\'t have to ask the database. You don\'t have to wait your time to first buy. It doesn\'t increase. You can just throw it into Redis and retrieve it really, really quickly. And Redis doesn\'t really break a sweat. If you have a thousand people asking questions, it\'s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe at a hundred thousand, a million, then you know, it starts to consume some resources. But it\'s just a really, really fast key value store. And. Ultimately object cashing helps you reduce the load on your database, which in most cases, I wanna say unless you have these, you know, 250 plugin, web percent stalls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Big chunk of your response time is always taking up by talking to the database, right? Mm-hmm. ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I, I haven\'t seen a lot of 250 plugin my press installs. You run into those very often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Uh, I don\'t, I not directly, but [00:07:00] you know, working. The guys at Page Lee and some other hosting companies I see. Really horrendous What setups that it\'s, it feels abusive, what they\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s just, it\'s, it\'s cruel what, what they\'re doing with the service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right? Yeah. I I\'m sure there\'s, there\'s plenty of, We\'ve probably touched a few of those here and here and there. Everyone\'s experience, um, just keep adding to it. Mm-hmm. . But the, the thing with Adri cash, um, That\'s really valuable is it doesn\'t matter whether those queries come from the back end or whether you\'re in the Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unit or not. And that\'s traditionally been people are working, um, doing a lot of writing inside their content management. And then if you have multiple users back there, there\'s really nothing that traditional cash would. Offer you. I remember there was this old plugin, um, I used for a long time. Mark Jake with, had written that, um, did try to do some smart things to cash some on the back end, [00:08:00] um, when you had multiple users going, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, if, if you\'re caching, well, it\'s not, Is it caching queries? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> yeah, , it\'s unclear. Um, it\'s not a query. Cash query caching would be select user one from, you know, WP Onco users that would be specifically cashing this result. And some MyQ Marie BI was actually do this internally. If the same query happens, then they just send a cash response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s more that WordPress says, Hey, I wanna. Look up this one user and then WordPress function itself. Check, Do I already have this in cash? Instead of cashing the query, it just cashes the object. Hence object cashing. But to speak to what you said earlier, they\'re just there. Yes. The advantage of object cashing, I always, I\'m so involved in it, so I forget how to properly explain it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe in the, Explain to me like I\'m five, the big advantages. It\'s easy to install a plugin like WP Rocket or. , [00:09:00] I don\'t know what the go-to standard is nowadays to get some browser cashing going. So if you have anonymous traffic, if you have the Google crawler going to your website, that you serve these static pre-generated HDML files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don\'t have even talk to anything, you just, the server just has to redefine and send it back, which is really, really fast, like milliseconds. However, the moment you\'re logged in, if you have a community. Buddy boss, or if you have something here, shopping cart with wms, you\'re not an anonymous visitor anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then every request when you wanna browse to the next category in wms, for example, you always have to talk to my sequel. And now if you do a flash sale with a thousand people at the same time on you site, You always will hit the object cash and it\'s just nice that it\'s whether you\'re in the back end, whether you are logged in, used on the front end with a shopping guard or you know, just commented, object cashing will reduce the response times of the page load times [00:10:00] for all of these requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only anonymous traffic. It\'s really good to have both, to have a page cash and an object cash because you know, a fast back end, maybe even the page generation. when you run your, Hey, warm up my page cash would be faster because it doesn\'t have to hammer your my SQL server. Um, but yeah, that\'s, that\'s the, the essence, it, it cashes all requests or all it cashes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not true. It cashes many parts that affect all requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Yeah. I noticed the big difference, uh, when we started using it, uh, with Pagely, and I think in some other context I have, um, yeah. Cause that\'s traditionally been the, the big problem with, with WordPress, if you\'re trying to use it as a community site or you, you\'ve got a forum or, uh, Yeah, some of a social site and a lot of people are logged in, so there\'s very little that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That page cashing would do anything for. So, um, [00:11:00] In my recollection, that was the major problem hosts had. There were more and more WordPress sites and others of its generation. They\'re all PHP in my sequel. Um, and so you would have someone just getting hammered with a lot of concurrent visitors. Maybe they don\'t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the page doesn\'t. Has like 50, a hundred queries. It\'s reasonable, but there\'s like 300 people doing that all at once. Or you have someone who has like the 250 plugins and it\'s like a hundreds of queries to load the, the front page. And it took a close look at that at one point with, uh, with another guy on the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And um, you would see like one, even if it was one out of a hundred queries that just went. It just never came back. , and you wouldn\'t get a full page load. Um, was that, is that still a [00:12:00] scaling issue that every host has to deal with? Um, or is that becoming a thing of the past? With, with stuff like object</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> cashing, having an object, Cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what press helps, um, because it\'s not really designed. To run a community to run these highly dynamic sites. We\'re making dm, we\'re making it work. I think the buddy boss guys talked to me recently and they said that just a load of feed of any given user, like you logged in, lot of feed. It\'s 300 my queries or SQL queries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people I think, use Marie db. I can\'t speak too much about what the challenges of hosting companies are. Um, I do see. Here and there, The stories and scaling the database over seems often an issue. I don\'t know what it\'s like in shared hosting. This is not my expertise, but yeah. Um, it\'s a, it\'s a hard [00:13:00] challenge to, to scale WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s, And it\'s my business now, it\'s, it\'s hard to scale and we have better tools, we have more powerful service. It\'s working, but it\'s, it\'s definitely pushing the edge of what it\'s meant to be doing initially. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> And is that how you got into this? Just because, well, you had a kind of history with WordPress and, and Lael, um, does it naturally, Does the nature of working with a WordPress for long lend itself to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, I gotta deal with some performance issues. Um, but what was your way into that? Becoming a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> main focus? Yeah, I was working as a freelancer and I was working on this really large Ttra community, um, as a women run company, which was kind of funny as like, I think when I left there was 50 women and me, and it was a fantastic work environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could say and. [00:14:00] The, It was like online learning, online courses. We didn\'t really have any tools when we started. I think I know 10 years ago, eight years ago, there was no good tools out there and at some point we started using Access Ally to connect with part and was just always a performance nightmare and I wanted to use an object answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran into the same problem that now people run into and come to me essentially, or to other people like Pan. And they\'ve got a reddish caching plug in as well. That\'s, the data was just a sudden there so much load, page load signs were low and each page had, you know, three, 400 comments and just to load them, it was just not feasible to always ask the SQL Server and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saw what\'s out there and it was kind of a bit dire, the situation. So I forked one of, I do not remember who it was. There was a popular Redis plugin, but Eric man, Eric man, I think way back in the day, released something where it was just unmaintained. I forked it, and now it grew to like, [00:15:00] I know a hundred thousand users probably a lot more because most people just use the upstream object cash drop and not the full plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that, um, Cloud Linux is using now Spin up, WP Blue Host. A lot of big hosts are using it, so the 100,000 users might be with Misleading, and I just scratched my own itch. I needed a good Redis plugin and it just kept on growing. That\'s how I kind of, you know, got into this and got started with it. I, I needed faster page load times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I think that\'s, that\'s a, not that un uncommon of a, of a story, but you, what\'s unique is to, to build a product as, as successful as, um, as Object Cash Pro, I imagine. Um, how many, how many hosting partners are you working with now with that? Because it\'s a, there\'s the free plugin, but then there\'s the, um, the, there\'s the, [00:16:00] I guess the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top shelf, high, high end premium version, that that\'s, is that mostly gonna be of use to a hosting market?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Um, yeah. And individual, like the small medium businesses that, you know, if you run an eCommerce side, and we have many customers like that. Mm-hmm. , they have eCommerce sites, they make $50,000 a month in revenue and they run their own either infrastructure, have a tiny engineering team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two, three guys run their own infrastructure because often when you have these large scale sites, it\'s tricky to find a hosting company that will serve that. Right. And I recommend Pagely personally because they seem to be able to just scale out. Um, What was the question again? ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> I\'m thinking Yeah. Whether I That was hosting buttons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Answered it. Yeah. If so, there are larger, So, so the, the client market for object cash bros is not just hosts, but businesses that are large [00:17:00] enough where they\'re monthly revenue, they can quantify exactly what performance is costing them. Yes. So if you are shaving. Off $10,000 worth of bandwidth. You know, it\'s, it, you, you can be that precise about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That that\'s, um, yeah. You know, this is a measurable quantity and your, your value is, um, auto, it sells itself, I suppose. Right. Is that, is that kind of how you</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> approach? Yeah, and because I believe in open source, there\'s always the free version that gives you a lot of benefits already. Um, there\'s been these studies from Amazon, Walmart, Etsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google where every 10th of a second a hundred milliseconds page load delays cost you. I think 1% conversion rate. Companies who worry about those numbers, they should be using Object, cash Pro. Yeah. Or if you just want the best of the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there\'s that side of it too. That\'s it. It\'s probably fairly quantifiable what you\'re losing in customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:00] Um, and just you\'re paying for less efficient, You\'re paying to lose customers if you, if you can\'t, can\'t serve, um, pages efficiently at scale. So, All right. Um, Do you want to talk more about your, your background and, and history, or do you like to, you know, I imagine there\'s some things farther back that maybe suggest some things about you and, and why you shaped your business this way, because, We\'ve talked about that before, and you know, this isn\'t, this isn\'t something you want to grow into, uh, a massive company where you become a manager of, of a support desk , or you, you know, that\'s under you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'ve got people, you\'ve got engineers and, and support people. Um, this is something you wanted to remain hands on and, um, in a particular way so, Are there things in your experience and you know, the rest of life that made you aware of that, [00:19:00] um, about yourself? Because, you know, the standard stereotypical model is let\'s like on, let\'s make this thing as big as we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Yeah. Cava</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> dozen,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, yeah. I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m neuro atypical and I, whatever. I touched a knife I wanted to do, figured out myself. I mean, I, I really enjoy learning from other people and I constantly ask other people about things and advice, but. Just seeing the standard model of you start a business, you get some funding, then you rent an offer, and I just, I can\'t be asked to, to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I wanna do things my way. That works for me, meaning working from home, I. In my underwear. Kind of, that\'s the, the picture you, you can visualize there. I, it works for me to be quiet by myself to focus time. If I want to take three [00:20:00] days off, I will and not be forced into this nine to five productivity model because it doesn\'t serve my, I don\'t wanna say best interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve never really articulated this. Um, it doesn\'t work for me. It\'s, I work long, hard hours, sometimes months in a row and sometimes I just take time off and all I wanna do is mo lawn and go for work. That flexibility, I think, really allowed me to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>maybe make the best product I could possibly make. And I just essentially, I just wanted to do things my way. Even with the pricing model, of course, looking at all the other WordPress plugins, this pricing model, I think hasn\'t changed in the last 10 years. Five years. I don\'t know what the first paid plugin was except for, was it, um, Kareem with crowd favorite?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He had this one plug and I was, I dunno, [00:21:00] $500 a month or like some crazy amount, the, where you could migrate between sites with this one outlier. Everybody does the same pricing with, you know, a couple of dollars a month, maybe less than a hundred a year, and you get your unlimited license to me didn\'t work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to keep it small. I wanted to have a hundred customers that pay me a hundred dollars a month. That would be my full-time work and support a hundred companies individually. That was the initial intention support a hundred companies because I can\'t, that wouldn\'t, wouldn\'t be too far out of my capabilities and it wouldn\'t completely drown me in work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that\'s how I really priced ocp. This is, this is what I wanted and. What I\'m seeing now is that I can serve the WebPress industry much more by working with hosting companies, and I\'m talking with a lot more than, uh, listed on my website officially, who already, you know, signed up. There\'s a few bigger announcements coming now with Word Cam BS that I don\'t think I can talk about or would be, It\'s not my [00:22:00] place to her to share these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but yeah, I just, I wanted to. I wanna do this, do things my way. That was, it was really important to me, and I\'m really glad I did because I\'m also seeing that I don\'t think I\'m a good employer. Um, unlike people. What\'s his face? Joshua? Joshua Trouble? Yes. I think he was a really, it\'s, he seemed, Maybe you can leave some notes here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, if anybody\'s working for him. He seems like a really good boss and, I\'d like to be like him, but I\'m not, or at least not at this point. And may, maybe I\'ll get there and I want to grow and scale. What, what I would like is I would like someone to come in, be the CT cto, as ceo, take over the company, and I\'m down with whether this is raising money or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting, you know, with all the acquisitions, I think it makes sense for a established, skilled team to come in and grow this. But as long as I\'m [00:23:00] not on my own, but have a very small team, which I have right now, I don\'t, I don\'t wanna just grow and grow and grow. That\'s not my, I wanna create a good product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanna have happy customers and not have depression because I\'m burning the candle at both. . Yeah. Do</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> do you think that, that to me doesn\'t, man, I, I, I resonate with that a lot. I, I feel that a lot. I, I feel like there\'s a lot of, well, maybe not a lot, but proportionally, but that there\'s a, there\'s a culture in, in WordPress among developers and, and others that is kind of the smallest, beautiful Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Approach. And have you found other, like others? Kind of supporting, validating that or other people you think have done</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> that except that all the smallest beautiful gets bought up. . Yeah, they do. But then because we have these, oh, what do you call them? [00:24:00] Conglomerates now, like with the cloud waste acquisition today, um, by digital ocean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are these giant, I dunno, visually speaking skyscrapers, you know, there\'s a bunch of them, but there are so many CRAs in the pavement in between that where smallest, beautiful can grow and you have like beautiful little happy, healthy flowers. I don\'t know what the, where the analogy is going. Um, There\'s space to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s always issues in between where you have small companies that can solve a problem that there\'s so many that exist in workers and create a really good solution, and then they will grow and maybe they\'ll be bought up and integrated in the big sky scrapers. Maybe not that, that it doesn\'t really matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s always space for small, whether it\'s a startup or just a small business or your, your site project to, to flourish. I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, I was thinking of John Christopher, who\'s you, you probably saw some of that in post [00:25:00] Slack and his give attention because it\'s an unusual, um, approach with organized wp. Um, yeah, he goes way back with, He\'s very intentional about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s actually a project that has a previous plugin behind it goes back 10 years or so. So even when he was doing search WP and from what I was reading and hearing, A large part of it sounds, sounds like you, where part of the thinking is not just a technical or revenue oriented planning, but how is this something that fits into my life where my relationship with my customers is meaningful?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that kind of connects with what I\'m hearing from you about like yeah, you don\'t want the, the stress. Over promising and delivering cuz your own scale has gotten out. Like, that\'s, that\'s what I\'ve found most painful and personally a barrier in, um, [00:26:00] freelancing. You know, if, if you\'re doing you, it doesn\'t, it wasn\'t, it\'s not something that quality can maintain at, at scale and to the extent you put relationships and maybe in your own community, into your clients, um, that really matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you, uh, you feel. Like you\'re letting people down if, if you can\'t, so, and I don\'t, I think they\'re at a point of scale. No one cares anymore. Right. They don\'t care. A big conglomerate, like you\'re not a successful</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> number. The customer service, this is always what I think about, and I\'m sure I\'ve shared this once or twice before where I don\'t wanna interact with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customers or people like this. I have my friends and I have my personal world where I wanna interact with humans, but on the internet there\'s too many sketchy people out there. So to me, one big goal was to keep customer service as minimal. And what\'s the opposite of hostile? Um, peaceful . As [00:27:00] nourishing as possible to me being an open source maintainer for, I dunno, 18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>18 years maybe. Mm-hmm. started with like half a mint back in the day, if anybody remembers that. Yeah, I do. Only the old people and Sean Inman, Iam, I dunno what his name is, but, um, you know, this analytics software, being an open source maintainer for so long, I, I saw the progression. Maybe I\'m so jaded now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the internet has changed and there\'s more people now I\'m not. But back in the day, it was really pleasant to interact with users of my software that I wanted to write and publish for free. And over the years I just saw that it\'s more, not more and more, but the percentage of shitty and hostile and interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know if I can curse on this podcast here. Um, I think just the F word probably, maybe I\'ll refrain from using it became. It\'s more [00:28:00] unpleasant to me. And with object aspro, I wanted to have the same thing where I, I make a software, people pay me for the service every month to use the best of the best, but they didn\'t talk to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was my, my goal. And instead of keeping them away and not responding to customer service requests, I wanted to create software that is so stupid, reliable that they don\'t have to talk to me and bring back everything I learned from my many years in the Laville community. Bring this back. Test driven development, reliability as a, as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number one core value of, of the software, not performance, not all the fancy belts and whistles and, and cool designs, not reliability, just you install it and you don\'t have to think about it because it just works. If there\'s an error, it recovers by itself. That was the intention because I don\'t wanna do customer service as my, my, my life, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I could scale and hire people, but I know why have a whole customer service team, What if the [00:29:00] software just works? And right now it\'s slowly changing over the last, let\'s say, I think it\'s almost three years now in ste, in November, um, two and a half years, let\'s say the majority of my days is I work, I do whatever I want, I can, I can drive my businesses forward, whether it\'s the sales and marketing or whether it\'s software and I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have been doing five minutes of customer service so far, and now it\'s slowly getting to like 10 minutes a day, which is still delightful to me, but it\'s 10 minutes now. I\'m not stoked about it, so I\'m working on making all these questions that over and over ask, and in the customer service chat or emails I integrate into the software, so I wanna bring it down to five minutes by just making it more intuitive, more reliable, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explan explanatory. Explanatory. Kind of like the apple iPhone where you, it just works for the most part, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Some, I, I can, I can hear people, I, I can read minds of [00:30:00] like, you know, you, you\'re talking on the one hand of like putting yourself out of business almost. But on the other hand, I can also imagine a lot of WordPress plug-in developers and, and far beyond that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>10 minutes. 10 minutes a day. One guy on support. That\'s, that\'s like paradise . Yeah. Cause the, the, the, for years and years and, and ongoing, the, the, probably the single most common, um, uh, complaint and, and it\'s more than a complaint. It\'s a life. It\'s a quality of life. Mm-hmm. issue when you listen to developers and product owners with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a support desk and it\'s, it\'s where the highest frustrations are and where they end up spending its money, time, and, and your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Mm-hmm. . So, and to me it\'s, my personally till this thing here, it\'s my happiness, my, [00:31:00] my contentment, and how I feel about life. Doing a lot of customer service is not part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Uh, to be honest, both sides of that transaction don\'t really want to be in there. It\'s not, um, it\'s not where we wanna spend our time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Yeah. And if it\'s five minutes a day, I can put in the energy. I can be quite nice and helpful. But if it would be 2030, if it\'s an hour, and like this is what I gotta do if I wake up and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a coffee and new customer. So it\'s just, I don\'t wanna do it. I would probably sell the business to Digital Ocean and, and move on. It\'s, that\'s not the life that I wanna live. Right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> What, what allowed you to, to know that about yourself earlier on? So that just seems unusual. What, what takes you down that, that path of knowing your limitations and know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you want when it\'s the opposite of what everything else says, like go and grow. This is a form of growth, but it\'s not the [00:32:00] stereotype, the one we always think about of bigger, more people, more tickets that come with our support tickets. Mm-hmm. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> What? Think. Think what\'s? I think, I think the Ansys iowaska, psychedelic substances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you call them? plant medicines, if you wanna say. I think that\'s the answer. It could also be just I, because I\'m near atypical, I have to do things my way. Maybe that\'s it. But I definitely, as a human, I value introspection and self inquiry. It\'s top of my list of things that I like to do in life and with myself and what drives me and what I find interesting in myself and understanding how do I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to still function and how do other people work, which is a lot more challenging sometimes because there\'s someone that can be so irrational and self inquiry and [00:33:00] psychedelics allows me to. Or has allowed me to just be more self-aware than I was five years ago, 10 years ago, and just increase that. If that\'s a quantifiable number, which I don\'t, maybe it isn\'t, get to know myself more of like what makes me happy, what makes me, what helps me be content, or what nourishes me, What drains me, and being self-aware I am, I\'m a huge fan of that, that self inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there\'s no, if you don\'t leave any room for it, it\'s, it\'s gone. And that time is gone. I, I feel you on that. Um, yeah. The last five years have probably, for almost everyone, have been possibly the toughest, um, in our lives. I, I think that\'s probably not that unique. And a big part of it for me is, um, along with, with remote relationships and remote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and social isolation happening at the same [00:34:00] time that there\'s, um, it\'s been a complicated, um, situation to keep enough of your own head space and relationships and, and things like that, um, that are, that are closer to home. That, you know, traditionally we find our identity and grounding and meaning and, um, Yeah, it\'s just gotten so much harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it sounds like you\'ve kind of gone the, the opposite, opposite direction. Pretty successfully with, with that, ironically, by, as, as other people scale up and develop all these inefficiencies, here\'s this guy with this, with this product that solves that problem to some extent, remaining this kind of calm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Center of the wheel , it\'s like I\'m imagining the, the nun, everything else spinning around and you\'re trying to [00:35:00] do as few, uh, as little, as little movement within the center of that as as possible. Um, seems like a smart, desirable way to work. To me, um, it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> wasn\'t,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Have you changed, has anything changed in, in your practices, in, in models or is this pretty confirmed at, at this point, this is how you want to do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re, it sounds like you\'re entertaining some idea of business partners. You know, as long as you have a, a role that allows, allows you to, to have the, the space and, and activity that you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> I think it\'s, um, it\'s a good question. I dunno if I have an answered this. Um, I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>because it\'s such a loud voice on the outside, everybody does the same thing. This is how you speak, this is how you [00:36:00] behave. This, there\'s so much conformity and we all wanna do this. As you know, talking apes. Because this, It\'s such a reinforcement. I think it\'s called something cultural head. Gem. Gem. Gem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. That\'s the word. Yeah. This is my ESL coming out here. Where it\'s over and over reinforced that it\'s good to be efficient. As a German, this is, I relate to this a lot, but um, it\'s, efficiency is important. Work is important. First question is, what do you do? Like everything is so work centric that it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes hard to put aside. So I still entertained the thought of like, Hmm, can I do this my way again, , Can I do this in a way that works for me? Can I be efficient or can I support growth my way? It\'s hard to just shut it out because it\'s so dominant in all of, at least the societies that I live in and [00:37:00] the circuits that I live in where money and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are you doing within like that, the values are just so reinforced externally. That to me to again, find, I\'m gonna quote Joshua Strayer again here. Like, what do I actually wanna do with my life? Um, not that he\'s the first question you ever asked me that, but how do, what do I want? And, and, and forgetting my inner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes happens, and maybe those are the moments that I think about growth and investment. Yeah. And, and scaling out. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I definitely see to, to switch gears here as well, I definitely see being, working with hosting companies the last couple of years, maybe the last years last year more and. I can make a bigger impact in the workforce community if I would have proper backing and, and, [00:38:00] uh, better team. And seeing now working on this particular product for the last close to three years or three years, probably with the development cycle, I\'m really good at product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m good at figuring out with people need. In my five minutes of customer service, I get enough information figuring out what they need. Being technical enough to bridge the gap and, and creating quality products. That\'s kind of the, the pride or that\'s what I\'m proud of or take pride in. And I, in an idea world, I\'d love to focus on that and not think about receipts and my.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accounting balances and all these other things. I try to outsource these things, but there\'s so much more to a business, so much more including customer service. Just focusing on product would be, I think, a very idea idyllic state for me to be in, of just, I get to just [00:39:00] create and make the world a better place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, less resource usage, faster, low times, less electricity being used and. Less headaches for people like the, the emotional impact of people worrying about the WordPress websites. That to me is a un quantifiable number that I really like to get higher. Um, why worry about your software? Like, let\'s worry about the relationships that we have or the what we want maybe, um, our ourselves and like these, the things that actually matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with software is making the lives a bit easier and less annoying. Um, I\'d love to do that. Back to your question of like, has anything changed? Just more and more discovering, running all of this myself and then outsourcing some engineering parts or the, you know, accounting, bookkeeping. Obviously it would be fun to just do product itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s not [00:40:00] my reality at the moment, but I would entertain it if it\'s, if it\'s done right. And I\'ve heard this a few times, whether this is the Pagely acquisition or WP Media, the WP Rocket guys, there seems to be companies out there that are still have a lot of financial backing, but they\'re not,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I don\'t know how to say this. They\'re not cutthroat capitalists. Right machines. Good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> disadvantage maybe, but worth life. Worth living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> Yeah. Like the, the one group one or one group. Mm-hmm. one.com hosting. And in Scandinavia, they just seem to, maybe it\'s a Scandinavian model. Again, just more focus on Yeah, we all work, we all pick pride in that maybe or identify with what we do for, for, for work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not at the extreme expense of our personal lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. [00:41:00] I, I think who\'s gonna argue with that? and feel good, feel like they really mean it. But yeah, that is a, it does seem more and more like that\'s a, a culture and the spirit and ethos that\'s, that\'s been diminished over time. Mm-hmm. in open source and Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It needs, it needs advocates in</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> it\'s, Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> it\'s a, it\'s good to have voices for that, but there\'s also some really practical things to it. Some of what you were saying, I, I know you, um, if you wanna drive down headaches and inefficiencies and stuff that doesn\'t work and poor quality products, testing is probably your main answer to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For practically speaking, what can WordPress do to. take, take a lot of trouble off of, off of, um, individual shoulders and off, you know, off the project, I [00:42:00] suppose too. Is that, is that accurate that the, the role of testing and standards, um, are an area that we\'re, we</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> haven\'t, um, yeah. Really matured in? I think so, and I\'m still , I still dislike it, um, but I do it because it\'s, I wanna push a big release on a Friday afternoon and go camping for the weekend without having to worry about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I\'ve done this a few times now, like I try to release on a Friday afternoon and push big releases to, I don\'t know what, it\'s like 400,000 sites now. Um, Test driven development, whether this is, yeah, whether this is test driven development, meaning first you write your tests and then you write the software, or if you do it after the fact and you spend the extra, you know, 30% I think it is on, on average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, The extra time to write tests, get to, you don\'t have to chase the [00:43:00] 100% code coverage where every single line is tested, but at least test the major parts of your software and whether this is JavaScript browser integration testing, and when you click this button, something happens and it works. Or this is just following the, the paths and PHP of like when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens when you flush the cash by cli? Does it actually empty your red estate? Just having sanity checks in place? It\'s a very technical topic. Testing in general, there\'s, what\'s his name? Um, Chris Hard, The grumpy programmer, who is just his whole life seems to be an advocate for testing, um, in, in many, many different communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not exclusive to php, just test your software. And to me, that allows me to be confident in what I. To trust my own software cuz I\'m very flawed and make mistakes all the time. But my tests will tell me when I do and just have peace of mind over the weekend where I [00:44:00] can, I don\'t have to stress out about pushing out a release that might break other people\'s sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this has been a very frequent occurrence. And WordPress, anybody from, I\'m not gonna say any names, but I\'m sure we all write the stories that as a release and sudden. I don\'t know. Millions of websites are slower because there\'s no tests, so there\'s no quality. Qa, What\'s it called? Quality assurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quality qa. Qa, Yeah. There\'s no teams. And whether this is manual or I think it should be automated because why spend human hours trying to do this? Just take the time to write these test. It\'s. It helps me. And then also to this extent of like customers have, I think more trust in the software. When there\'s releases and there\'s no, Oh, buck fix is, Buck fix is buck fixes and many small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the the evolution of my free plugin, the Reddest object Cash. Sometimes when I do a big release, they do six [00:45:00] releases and 24 hours. It\'s so many people using it and something breaks for someone. And this is what I wanted to do different with Object Cash Pro. It\'s written from the ground up and it\'s test driven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there is no, it\'s not, not quite a hundred percent quote coverage at this point, but it\'s a very, It\'s thoroughly tested. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. And what\'s the barrier to that? Becoming more of the. in WordPress are, are you involved in the on the core test team at all? I know you do. Uhfor the new</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> performance team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I\'m not. I see that there is a lot of tests in WordPress core, like it\'s well tested. I think the, not the theme market, but the plugin market itself seems are probably a pain to test the plugin. Industry plugin. Severe is, testing is not a common thing. I, I don\'t see it very much. No few people seem to even talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t wanna be an [00:46:00] advocate for it. I have other things to do. Maybe I should do a presentation at some point at a conference just to like see the, So the seats, what do you call? Put the seats in the ground. Yeah. Yeah. It\'s, uh, it\'s really good. I don\'t know if there\'s anything in the way except for awareness and then actually taking the time to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it, it\'s time consuming. It\'s expensive. If it\'s 30% of the time that you write code, that if it\'s an hour, I don\'t know what 30% is, 20 minutes, 80 minutes, something like that. A third, let\'s say, of that time coding. , you would then spend writing tests. It\'s not fun. I, I don\'t, You can make it kind of fun with like a decent test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, a nice tooling, but it\'s still, you, you, you\'re doing this. However, for me, now down the road, seeing that I have three years of. Software in one place. I don\'t wanna test all these pieces that have written a year ago. They work, they can just stay [00:47:00] as they are, and if they break, I will know down the road and they can actually move a bit faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in the future of like whether this is adding new features or changing how timeouts work. The last release I pushed yesterday was adding connection retries and the few things broke and I, I just know I don\'t have. Abuse . I don\'t have to abuse my customers and they test it on their life production sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My tests will reveal these issues first, which I, I think it\'s the more customer friendly approach to not let your customers test your software. And, um, I listen to the Accidental Tech podcast the other day where Apple kind of dust is at scale. They just throw it out. Developers do the QA for them. I think that was the comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can\'t speak to that, but it reminds me of this talking about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, very much so. Yeah. Do you, do you think that that, um, WordPress is, you could say relative [00:48:00] isolation or under participation in the larger PHP world is part of the story too, that if, if there was more overlap and more. Mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relationships in, into, into things like Elle or a Million Possible Directions with, with PHP and is more, more directly involved with it. That, that, that would help, uh, that would enhance some things like, like stand uh, standards around testing and and so on. Um, we just kind of, our ecosystem and people do their own thing cause it\'s, they\'re not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re not, um, their peers are in a, in a different place than, say, someone working in, in a, a PHP framework somewhere</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> else. Yeah. I think there\'s, I mean, there\'s a lot of smart developers on WordPress as well that\'s maybe [00:49:00] cross to, to the other. Ecosystems over outside of WordPress and they include testing, whether this is Google engineers being hired or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, there is good tooling out there. I don\'t think we\'re too isolated. We definitely judge and look down upon, um, understandably so. Maybe that\'s just because of the lack of testing, but I, I don\'t even know how to solve this. To me it\'s a problem and maybe it would be enforcing tests for plugins with more than, I don\'t know, a thousand users on the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you can measure OB objectively. You can quantify the code coverage, whether let\'s say it\'s 80% what, whatever\'s a reasonable or 50%. , I dunno if you can have the main path. I, I, I don\'t know the, the details of this, but you could also enforce it such as like, Hey, you\'ve got now 12 months to test your software, and then it gets a little check mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, [00:50:00] this plugin has a test suite. I would need to build one for my free plugin. Now , But it, it might be a good, good idea and to include in that there\'s been a. Talk in deep What Core Performance? Performance Core, I don\'t know. They just changed the name, The performance team. Mm-hmm. , Um, to have, whether there\'s this badges that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you have a clean, what percent stall you install a plugin. How do the, my queries, like what\'s the impact of this plugin? How is performance being handled? And I dunno how much you can automate these tests, but maybe we need more reviewers that there is more high quality code a. On the wordpress.org, at least for the ones that have, um, you know, a hundred thousand, a million users that you know that these are actually properly tested for performance degradations or recessions, um, regressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry, so many recessions going on at the moment, and for [00:51:00] performance regressions or just for testing, I think that would be a decent approach. I don\'t know if this is feasible. Someone, what\'s her? Epstein, she something. Half Elf is on a Twitter profile. I don\'t, Yeah. You know what I\'m talking about. Yes. Um.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She, I think, runs the plugin team and I don\'t know what of the, what is possible and it\'s of course it\'s a big burden. Again, on that you, we push on open source developers and maybe there needs to be fun. I don\'t know how to solve this problem, but testing would definitely improve the overall trust in WordPress, that you can upgrade a plugin without things going slow or breaking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it would be a good approach and. I would say it\'s certainly part of the secret sauce for Object Cash Pro and its success. It just, you can trust that it\'s reliable. Yeah. And business is first. Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> as an alternative to putting it on on.org, there\'s always the possibility I\'ve wondered about this, like why the, I\'m not aware of this happening, but [00:52:00] in a maturing market and ecosystem that I think we do have, there\'s the possibility of industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>cooperation and self-regulation to some extent, where you, those larger plugin, um, companies could on their own, see the, see that value and decide on a standard amongst themselves some common tooling or, or practice or something like that and do their part to kind of police that end of the, the market or set an example that, that sounds like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very strong policing, but I mean you\'re, you know, pleasing bugs. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> oh, we already have guidelines for the plugins, what you can and can\'t do. Yeah, it\'s very clear and they all make sense. Maybe adding performance and test coverage to that could be at least a discussion. I\'m sure it has been. I will talk to Felix at work, us about this on the country today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. That\'s, uh, yeah, that\'s definitely a, a [00:53:00] progressive direction to, to move in. Um, where, where do you see, um, opportunities and, you know, for, for you and, and just WordPress in general, where are they, where are the opportunities and I guess the, the risks and, and threats. People would often seem to have more of those in mind, but, um, how those two relative quantities is they\'re, Which is more on your mind and, and what are you, what are you seeing down the road?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> probably with everybody. I\'m more, I think more about the risks. Yeah. And threat than the opportunities. The monkey brand. Mm-hmm. , I don\'t know if an answer to, if I have an answer to this, I, some of them are a bit concerned of like, how long is WordPress around? , but it doesn\'t, it\'s not slowing. Maybe this is just like you said, the talking apr, [00:54:00] I, it\'s not slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s acquisitions everywhere. I don\'t see it dying out for whatever reason. All the replacements like it\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess, yeah, I don\'t know. I, I, I don\'t, I don\'t think I have an answer to that question. Sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> That\'s fine. It\'s a big, big, wide open one. Um, I, I think a lot of, a lot of things you, you\'ve touched on, I wish I, you know, we, we hear more, and I, I hope resonates with, uh, a lot of people. We don\'t often connect the human social embeddedness of our lives with the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re doing or not openly or we don\'t share that and, you know, why else are you doing what you do? Um, some people are pretty open about it, but, um, I would, I would like to hope that there\'s, there\'s opportunity in this space for people who wanna work that way, who are wanna work like you [00:55:00] do, and that this is, this is a good model that however big everything else may get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s those cracks, like you said, between. The sidewalk where there\'s room for a relatively low stress. Good, good work. Um, and</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Till Krüss:</strong> I\'m glad you found that. If there\'s any more questions, if, if you like listening to this, if you enjoy the, the, this conversation, the stories, if there\'s anything the listeners want to hear more about or any questions, I\'m always happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hit me up on Slack, on post status, Slack for of course, WordPress, Slack email. You know, or send questions to Dan and we can do, uh, if there\'s the demand for it. Uh, episode two on this.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 13:15:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress – September 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13596\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14922:\"<p>September was an exciting month with the return of many in-person WordCamps, WordPress Translation Day, and preparations for WordPress 6.1.

Automattic-sponsored contributor Aaron Robertshaw published a video, illustrating how the block editor now supports  dropping an image onto an empty paragraph block to replace it with a new Image block.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The site editor has also added drag-and-drop capabilities for blocks and patterns in the new zoomed-out view, which was added in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-14-1-improves-navigation-block-adds-experimental-zoomed-out-view\">Gutenberg version 14.1</a>. It zooms out to focus on building and composing patterns, allowing users to move sections around without affecting the inner blocks. It can be enabled under &#8220;Experiments.&#8221; In 14.3, users can drag blocks and patterns right onto the canvas with an overhead view that makes it easy to place in between existing blocks.</p>\n\n\n\nvideo source: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44402\">Gutenberg PR #44402</a>\n\n\n\n<p>This version also introduces new support for alt + arrow keyboard combinations for navigating blocks. Robertshaw explained how they work:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>For example, if your cursor is towards the end of a long paragraph, you can quickly press <code>alt + up arrow</code> to move to the beginning of that paragraph. If you are already at the beginning of a text block, you’ll move to the start of the previous paragraph. Similarly, <code>alt + down arrow</code> will move you to the end of a block of text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The Styles typography controls have been updated to include the Tools Panels that users have available in the Block Settings interface. This makes the experience more consistent and expands the capabilities to allow for resetting the values.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes dozens of fixes and improvements to design tools, components, the Block API, and more. Check out the changelog in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/13/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-3-12-october/\">announcement post</a> for the full list of updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 14.3 will not be included in the upcoming WordPress 6.1 release but will be rolled into core the next time around.

I recorded this conversation with Till back in August, and it\'s about time we pushed it out.

There\'s likely a lot of opportunity in aligning on performance as a key, common interest for product, agency, and hosting companies in the WordPress space. <em>And</em>, as Till\'s example shows, a small WordPress company, or company of one that wants to stay that way, still can thrive today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper\">Till\'s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it..) 5-10 <em>minutes</em> a day on support — which he aims to decrease. How? Testing to ensure the highest quality. It\'s an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third party WordPress product ecosystem, Till insists — and I think he\'s right about that and much else. </p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 20:55:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: Shortcodes Ultimate Plugin Patches CSRF Vulnerability in Version 5.12.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=138591\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"https://wptavern.com/shortcodes-ultimate-plugin-patches-csrf-vulnerability-in-version-5-12-1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1375:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate/\">Shortcodes Ultimate plugin</a>, used on more than 700,000 WordPress sites for creating things like tabs, buttons, and accordions, has patched a vulnerability in version 5.12.1. The plugin&#8217;s changelog simply says, <em>&#8220;This update fixes a security vulnerability in the shortcode generator</em>. To the author&#8217;s credit,  the changelog clearly denotes it as a security update, although it doesn&#8217;t offer specific details. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability was reported by researcher Dave Jong at Patchstack and is <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38086\">logged at the National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD) as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability leading to plugin preset settings change. It was patched two weeks ago and the NVD published the advisory this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time, the vulnerability is not known to have been exploited, but users are advised to update to the latest version. Based on WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes-ultimate/advanced/\">stats</a>, 46% of the plugin&#8217;s user base is running on versions older than 5.12.x.
